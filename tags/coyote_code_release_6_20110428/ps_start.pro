; NAME:
;   PS_START
;
; PURPOSE:
;
;    The purpose of PS_START and PS_END is to make it easy to set-up
;    for and close a PostScript file. The programs work in close conjunction
;    with PSCONFIG, another program from the Coyote Library.
;
;    If ImageMagick  (http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) is installed 
;    on your computer, you can easily convert PostScript output to JPEG, PNG, and TIFF
;    image output. (See the keywords to PS_END.)

;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;       PS_START
;       Various graphics commands here...
;       PS_END
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS FOR PS_START:
; 
;       CANCEL:       An output keyword that is set to 1 if the user cancelled from
;                     PS_Config. Otherwise, set to 0.
; 
;       CHARSIZE:     If this keyword is set, the !P.Charsize variable is set to this
;                     value until PS_END is called.
;                     
;       FONT:         Set this to the type of font you want. A -1 selects Hershey 
;                     fonts, a 0 selects hardware fonts (Helvetica, normally), and
;                     a 1 selects a True-Type font. Set to 0 by default.
;
;       GUI:          The default behavior is to use PSCONFIG to configure the
;                     PostScript device silently. If you wish to allow the user
;                     to interatively configure the PostScript device, set this
;                     keyword.
;                     
;       KEYWORDS:     This output keyword contains the keyword structure returned 
;                     from PS_Config.
;                     
;       NOMATCH:      Normally, PS_Start will try to "match" the aspect ratio of the
;                     PostScript file "window" to the current display window. If this
;                     keyword is set, then this doesn't occur, giving the user the
;                     option of specifying the size and offsets of the PostScript 
;                     window directly though appropriate keywords.
;
;       QUIET:        If set, informational messages are not set. 
;
;       SCALE_FACTOR: Set this to the PostScript scale factor. By default: 1.
;
;       TT_FONT:      The name of a true-type font to use if FONT=1. By default, "HELVETICA".
;
;       Any keyword supported by PSCONFIG can be used to configure the PostScript device.
;       Common keywords would include FILENAME, XSIZE, YSIZE, XOFFSET, YOFFSET, etc. See
;       the PSCONFIG documentation for details. If size keywords are used, you *must* set
;       the NOMATCH keyword.
;
; COMMON BLOCKS:
;
;       _$FSC_PS_START_   Contains the PS_STRUCT structure for communication between
;                         PS_START and PS_END.
;
; SIDE EFFECTS:
;
;       When PS_START is called, the current graphics device is set to "PS" (the PostScript 
;       device). When PS_END is called the current graphics device is returned to the device
;       in effect when PS_START was called.
;       
;       PS_Start uses the current display window as a template for the Postscript
;       file. Thus, if the display window is wider than it is higher, output is
;       in Landscape mode. To set the size of the PostScript "window" yourself, be
;       sure to set the NOMATCH keyword to 1.
;       
;       To display surface plots correctly the FONT keyword should be set to 1.
;       Otherwise, the default font is 0, or hardware fonts when outputting to 
;       PostScript.
;
; RESTRICTIONS:
;
;       Requires numerous programs from the Coyote Library. To convert PostScript files
;       to PNG, JPEG, GIF, and TIFF files requires ImageMagick be installed on your
;       computer and configured correctly. You can download Coyote Library programs here:
;
;             http://www.dfanning.com/programs/coyoteprograms.zip
;
;       ImageMagick can be found here:
;
;              http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php
;              
;       NOTE: In this version of PS_START, I have added the "alpha" option to the ImageMagick
;       command. This is a relatively recent addition to the convert command. (Added in ImageMagick
;       version 6.3.4). Your version of ImageMagick may not allow it. If so, simply comment out the
;       alpha command in the code below (on or about line 242), or uncomment it, as the case may be. 
;
; EXAMPLE:
;
;       To create a line plot in a PostScript file named lineplot.ps and
;       also create a PNG file named lineplot.png for display in a browser,
;       type these commands.
;
;       PS_Start, FILENAME='lineplot.ps'
;       Plot, Findgen(11), COLOR=cgColor('navy'), /NODATA, XTITLE='Time', YTITLE='Signal'
;       OPlot, Findgen(11), COLOR=cgColor('indian red')
;       OPlot, Findgen(11), COLOR=cgColor('olive'), PSYM=2
;       PS_End, /PNG
;
; NOTES:
;
;       You can easily configure any modifications you like for your PostScript output
;       by setting fields in the plot and axis system variables (!P, !X, !Y, and !Z).
;       The modifications currently made by default in this program are these:
;
;          !P.Thick = 2
;          !P.CharThick = 2
;          !X.Thick = 2
;          !Y.Thick = 2
;          !Z.Thick = 2
;          !P.Font = 0
;          
;        The !P.Charsize variable is set differently on Windows computers, and depending
;        on whether !P.MULTI is being used. On Windows the default is 1.25, or 1.00 for
;        multiple plots. On other computers, the default is 1.5, or 1.25 for multiple plots.
;        If true-type fonts are being used (FONT=1), the default is 1.5, or 1.25 for 
;        multiple plots.
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;
;       Written by: David W. Fanning, 20 May 2008.
;       Slight modification to allow filenames with spaces in them.
;       Added NoMatch keyword. 17 March 2009. DWF.
;       Added a number of keywords to make these commands more configurable. 19 March 2009. DWF.
;       Only set thickness system variables if starting system variables are set to their
;           default values (namely, 0). This allows users to set their own system variables
;           before they call PS_START, rather than after. 23 March  2009. DWF.
;       Moved PS_END to its own file to allow the IDLExBr_Assistant to work properly. 7 April 2009. DWF.
;       Modified to allow PostScript page type to be stored for future processing with FixPS. 9 August 2009. DWF.
;       Added NoFix keyword to PS_END calls to repair previous, but unused set-ups. 1 Nov 2010. DWF.
;       Added Charsize keyword to PS_START. 14 Nov 2010. DWF.
;       Changed the way default character sizes are set. 19 Nov 2010. DWF.
;       Added CANCEL and KEYWORDS output keywords. 16 Jan 2011. DWF.
