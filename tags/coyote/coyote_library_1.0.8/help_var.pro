; NAME:
;       HELP_VAR
;
; PURPOSE:
;
;       The purpose of this program is to display HELP on just
;       the variables at the level in which HELP_VAR is called.
;       It is similar to the HELP command, except that compiled
;       functions and procedures are not displayed.

; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;       HELP_VAR
;
; REQUIRED INPUTS:
;
;       None.
;
; SIDE EFFECTS:
;
;       Memory is allocated for each variable, in turn, then deleted.
;       Uses undefined and unsupported ROUTINE_NAMES function. May not
;       work in all versions of IDL, including future versions.

; EXAMPLE:
;
;
;       PRO HELP_VAR_TEST
;          a = 4.0
;          b = Lindgen(11)
;          HELP_VAR
;       END
