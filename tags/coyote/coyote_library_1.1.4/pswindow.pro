; NAME:
;    PSWINDOW
;
; PURPOSE:
;
;    This function is used to calculate the size of a PostScript
;    window that has the same aspect ratio (ratio of height to
;    width) as the current display graphics window. It creates
;    the largest possible PostScript output window with the
;    desired aspect ratio. This assures that PostScript output
;    looks similar, if not identical, to normal graphics output
;    on the display.

; CATEGORY:

; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;    pageInfo = PSWINDOW()
;
; INPUTS:
;
;    None.
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
; 
;    ASPECTRATIO: Normally the aspect ratio is matched to the
;    aspect ratio (ratio of height divided by width) of the current
;    graphics window. However, this keyword can be used to select
;    a particular aspect ratio for the PostScript window. This should
;    be a floating point value.
;
;    CM: Normally the structure value that is returned from this
;    function reports its values in inches. Setting this keyword
;    causes the return values to be in units of centimeters.
;    
;    EUROPEAN: This keyword is depreciated in favor of METRIC.
;
;    FUDGE: A quick way to set symetrical XFUDGE and YFUDGE factors.
;    If this keyword is set to a value, XFUDGE and YFUDGE keywords are
;    set to the same value. Fudge factors are used only with some
;    printers and generally only when output is being sent to the
;    PRINTER device. (See the description of the XFUDGE and YFUDGE
;    keywords for additional information.)
;
;    LANDSCAPE: Normally, a landscape page is selected if the current 
;    graphics window is wider than it is tall. If you prefer a landscape
;    aspect window on a Portrait page, set the LANDSCAPE keywword to 0. 
;    Setting  this keyword to 1 will result in a landscape page no 
;    matter the size of the current graphics window.
;
;    MARGIN:  The margin around the edges of the plot. The value must be
;    a floating point value between 0.0 and 0.35. It is expressed in
;    normalized coordinate units. The default margin is 0.05.
;
;    METRIC: If this keyword is set, the program defaults change
;    so that the CM keyword is set to 1 and the PAGESIZE keyword is
;    set to "A4".
;
;    PAGESIZE: Set this keyword to a string indicating the type
;    of PostScript page size you want. Current values are "LETTER",
;    "LEGAL", and "A4". Default is "LETTER".
;
;    PRINTER: Set this keyword if the output will be used to
;    configure the PRINTER device, rather than the PS device.
;    (In the PRINTER device, offsets are always calculated from
;    the lower-left corner of the page and do not rotate in
;    Landscape mode, as they do with the PS device.) Note that
;    the PRINTER device is only able to accept these keywords
;    in IDL 5.1 and higher.
;
;    XFUDGE: Printers calculate the offset point from the printable
;    edge of the paper (sometimes), rather from the corner of the paper.
;    For example, on my Lexmark printer, both X and Y offsets are
;    calculated from a point 0.25 inches in from the edge. This keyword
;    allows you to set a "fudge" factor that will be subtracted from
;    the XOFFSET that is returned to the user. This allows you to create
;    output that is centered on the page. The fudge factor should be in
;    the same units as the returned size and offset values.
;
;    YFUDGE: Printers calculate the offset point from the printable
;    edge of the paper (sometimes), rather from the corner of the paper.
;    For example, on my Lexmark printer, both X and Y offsets are
;    calculated from a point 0.25 inches in from the edge. This keyword
;    allows you to set a "fudge" factor that will be subtracted from
;    the YOFFSET that is returned to the user. This allows you to create
;    output that is centered on the page. The fudge factor should be in
;    the same units as the returned size and offset values.
;
; OUTPUTS:
;
;    pageInfo: The output value is a named structure defined like
;    this:
;
;      pageInfo = {PSWINDOW_STRUCT, XSIZE:0.0, YSIZE:0.0, $
;         XOFSET:0.0, YOFFSET:0.0, INCHES:0, PORTRAIT:0, LANDSCAPE:0}
;
;    The units of the four size fields are inches unless the CM
;    keyword is set.
;
;    The output can be used to immediately configure the PostScript
;    or Printer device, like this:
;
;       Set_Plot, 'PS' ; or 'PRINTER'
;       Device, _Extra=pageInfo
;
; RESTRICTIONS:
;
;    The aspect ratio of the current graphics window is calculated
;    like this:
;
;       aspectRatio = FLOAT(!D.Y_VSIZE) / !D.X_VSIZE
;
; EXAMPLE:
;
;    To create a PostScript output window with the same aspect
;    ratio as the curently active display window, type:
;
;     pageInfo = PSWINDOW()
;     SET_PLOT, 'PS'
;     DEVICE, _Extra=pageInfo
;
;     To configure the PRINTER device:
;
;     pageInfo = PSWINDOW(/Printer, Fudge=0.25)
;     SET_PLOT, 'PRINTER'
;     DEVICE, _Extra=pageInfo
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;
;    Written by: David W. Fanning, November 1996.
;       Fixed a bug in which the YOFFSET was calculated incorrectly
;          in Landscape mode. 12 Feb 97.
;       Took out a line of code that wasn't being used. 14 Mar 97.
;       Added correct units keyword to return structure. 29 JUN 98. DWF
;       Fixed a bug in how landscape offsets were calculated. 19 JUL 99. DWF.
;       Fixed a bug in the way margins were used to conform to my
;          original conception of the program. 19 JUL 99. DWF.
;       Added Landscape and Portrait fields to the return structure. 19 JUL 99. DWF.
;       Added PageSize keyword, changed MARGIN keyword, and completely
;          rewrote most of the intenal code. 9 FEB 2000. DWF.
;       Fixed a bug in how I calculated the aspect ratio. 1 MAR 2000. DWF.
;       Added PRINTER keyword to return proper offset values for the
;          PRINTER device, where the offset location is not rotated. 1 MAR 2000. DWF.
;       Added PRINTER fudge factors to take into account that printer offsets are
;          calculated from the printable area of the paper, rather than the corner
;          of the paper. 8 AUG 2000. DWF.
;       Changed the default margin to 0.05 from 0.15. 29 Nov 2004, DWF.
;       Added EUROPEAN keyword and set LANDSCAPE mode if window wider than higher
;           as the default if LANDSCAPE is not set. 13 Dec 2010. DWF.
;       Added ASPECTRATIO keyword to allow user-specified window aspect ratio. 13 Dec 2010. DWF.
;       Depreciated EUROPEAN keyword in favor of METRIC. 31 Jan 2011. DWF.
