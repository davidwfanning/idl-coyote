The Coyote Library is an Open Source programming project, hosted at
http://idl-coyote.googlecode.com.

The Coyote Library evolved from work David Fanning was doing
teaching IDL courses and answering IDL questions on the IDL
newsgroup. It is meant to be a well-documented library that
demonstrates how to write solid (dare we say eloquent) IDL
programs that are easy to maintain and extend. You can learn
more about these programs and about IDL programming in general
at David's web page, Coyote's Guide to IDL Programming.
