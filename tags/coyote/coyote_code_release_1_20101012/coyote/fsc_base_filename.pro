; NAME:
;    FSC_BASE_FILENAME
;
; PURPOSE:
;
;    The purpose of this is to extract from a long file path, the
;    base file name. That is, the name of the actual file without
;    the preceeding directory information or the final file extension.
;    The directory information and file extension can be obtained via
;    keywords. The file is named so as not to interfere with FILE_BASENAME,
;    which was introduced in IDL 6.0 and performs a similar function.

; CATEGORY:
;
;    Utility.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;    baseFilename = FSC_Base_Filename(thePath)
;
; INPUTS:
;
;    thePath:      This is the file path you wish to extract a base file name from.
;                  It is a string variable of the sort returned from Dialog_Pickfile.
;
; KEYWORDS:
;
;    DIRECTORY:      The directory information obtained from the input file path.
;                    The directory always ends in a directory separator character.
;
;    EXTENSION:      The file extension associated with the input file path.
;
;    PATH_SEPARATOR: The string to use as a path separator. If undefined, the output
;                    of PATH_SEP() will be used.
;
; RETURN_VALUE:
;
;    baseFilename:   The base filename, stripped of directory and file extension information.
;
; RESTRICTIONS:
;
;    This is a quick and dirty program. It has been tested on Windows machines and *lightly*
;    tested on UNIX machines. Please contact me at the e-mail address above if you discover
;    problems.
;
; EXAMPLE:
;
;    IDL> thePath = "C:\rsi\idl7.8\lib\jester.pro"
;    IDL> Print, FSC_Base_Filename(thePath, Directory=theDirectory, Extension=theExtension)
;         jester
;    IDL> Print, theDirectory
;         C:\rsi\idl7.8\lib\
;    IDL> Print, theExtension
;         pro

; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;
;    Written by: David W. Fanning, 31 July 2003.
;    Modified by KaRo, 13 Feb. 2005 to allow dots in the filename.
;    Added PATH_SEPARATOR keyword. 25 July 2005. DWF.
;    Added ability to recongnize directory by path separator in last character. 19 Sept 2005. DWF.
;    If directory is blank (because a relative filename was passed), set to current directory. 6 Aug 2009. DWF.
