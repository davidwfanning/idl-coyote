; NAME:
;  SCALEMODIS
;
; PURPOSE:
;
;  MODIS corrected reflectance images often appear drab when initially processed
;  and displayed on a computer using BYTSCL. In fact, the resulting true-color 
;  images look nothing like the images you can find on the MODIS Rapid Response
;  web page (http://rapidfire.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/gallery/). After poking around on
;  the Internet for awhile, I discovered that the Rapid Response Team doesn't use
;  BYTSCL to prepare the images. Rather, they selectively scale portions of the
;  reflectance image, using a piecewise scaling with different slopes. This program
;  implements this Rapid Response Team algorithm.

; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;  scaledBand = ScaleModis(red, green, blue)
;
; ARGUMENTS:
;
;  red:           A two-dimensional array representing the corrected reflectance
;                 values of a MODIS image. This is a required parameter. If the
;                 green and blue parameters are also used, this parameter will 
;                 represent the red band of a RGB 24-bit scaled image that is returned.
;                 
;  green:         If the three parameters--red, green, and blue--are present, the returned
;                 array is a 24-bit true-color image, scaled appropriately. This parameter
;                 is used as the green band in such an image. The parameter is a two-dimensional
;                 array of corrected reflectance values.
;             
;  blue:          If the three parameters--red, green, and blue--are present, the returned
;                 array is a 24-bit true-color image, scaled appropriately. This parameter
;                 is used as the blue band in such an image. The parameter is a two-dimensional
;                 array of corrected reflectance values.
;                 
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;
;  RANGE:         A two-dimensional array that the input bands are first scaled into, prior to
;                 the differential scaling using the MODIS Rapid Response algorithm. The default
;                 input range is [-0.01, 1.10]. These values will be used to set the MIN and MAX
;                 keywords for the BYTSCL command in the initial scaling of the input bands.
;
;  CLOUD:         The MODIS Rapid Response team uses a slightly different scaling algorithm when
;                 the idea is to emphasize clouds in a MODIS scene. Set this keyword to use the
;                 alternate cloud scaling algorithm.
;
; OUTPUTS:
; 
;  scaledBand:    If a single 2D array is passed as the argument, then scaledBand is the scaled
;                 2D output array. If all three arguments are passed to the program, then scaledBand
;                 is a scaled 24-bit image that represents a true-color or false color representation
;                 of the three input bands.
;                 
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;
;  Written by: David W. Fanning, July 2009, using the IDL programs MODIS_FALSE_COLOR and
;     and SCALE_IMAGE for inspiration. I found these programs on the Internet when poking  
;     around MODIS web pages. I suspect, but I am not sure, these programs were originally  
;     written by Liam Gumley.
;  Minor changes to the ScaleIt function to be sure partitioning is done correctly. 5 Aug 2009. DWF.
