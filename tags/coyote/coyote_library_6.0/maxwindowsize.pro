; NAME:
;   MaxWindowSize
;
; PURPOSE:
;   Returns the resolution of the largest unobstructed graphics window that can be
;   created on this particular graphics device. Works properly for Windows and UNIX
;   computers, excluding Macintosh computers. There is no known way to find the resolution
;   of the largest unobstructed graphics window on a Macintosh computer, so a fudge factor
;   of 22 pixels is used to account for the Macintosh "dock".

;        Misunderstood Macintosh result. Now Mac treated like UNIX. 27 Oct 2010. DWF.
;        No known method for Macintosh computers. Resorting to a fudge factor

;        Code is total reversed for UNIX and Macintosh computers! Fixed. 16 Dec 2011. DWF.
;        Modified to only use IDLsysMonitorInfo for IDL 6.3 and higher. 23 Feb 2012. DWF.
