;   Provides a device-independent way to set the color decomposition state of the
;   current graphics device. Devices that do not have a DECOMPOSED keyword to the
;   DEVICE command are assumed to be in indexed color mode always.
;   
;   I have removed the Z-graphics buffer from being controlled by this program. I
;   do so reluctantly, but I am pragmatic enough to realize that progress forward
;   is necessarily slow and that I must recognize the reality of legacy IDL code.
;   
;   My personal view is that all graphics routines should use 24-bit decomposed
;   color. There are myriad advantages, but basically they boil down to this:
;   (1) You have 16.7 million colors available to you simultaneously, and (2) you
;   don't have to contaminate color tables to use drawing colors. Coyote Graphics
;   routines are in the habit of switching out of whatever color mode the user happens 
;   to be using, into 24-bit decomposed color mode, then switching back when finished
;   with its business. But, it is impossible to do this correctly in the Z-graphics
;   buffer.
;   
;   The reason for this is that in the Z-graphics buffer, you need to switch not only
;   the color mode, but also the pixel depth. In other words, I would prefer to set
;   the Z-graphics buffer up like this::
;   
;       Set_Plot, 'Z'
;       Device, Decomposed=1, Set_Pixel_Depth=24
;       
;   But, if I do that, then I need to set it back (for 99 people out of a 100) like this::
;   
;       Device, Decomposed=0, Set_Pixel_Depth=8
;       
;   Unfortunately, using this command will erase whatever is in the Z-graphics buffer!
;   
;   My solution to this problem is to leave it to the user to configure the Z-graphics buffer
;   the way they want it. If you configure it to use 24-bit decomposed color, all of the Coyote
;   Graphics routines will work as they normally do. If you configure it to use 8-bit indexed color,
;   which is the default configuration, then it will work "normally", but you will be in great
;   danger of contaminating the system color table. The reason for this is that Coyote Graphics
;   cannot "restore" the entry color table in the Z-buffer without obliterating what is already
;   in the graphics window. Users who work with indexed color are probably already very much
;   aware of this problem, so it shouldn't surprise them. (They might not expect this with
;   Coyote Graphics, but this is the price that has to be paid.)
;   
;   My suggestion is to put the Z-graphics configuration in your IDL startup file. Set it
;   up in 24-bit decomposed color mode, use Coyote Graphics to do all your graphical output,
;   and you will find things working perfectly. 
;   See `Configuring the Z-Graphics Buffer for Coyote Graphics <http://www.idlcoyote.com/cg_tips/configz.php>` 
;   for additional information.

; :Params:
;    state: in, required, type=integer, default=0
;         Set to 1 to set the current graphics device to decomposed color. Set to 0 
;         to set the current graphics device to indexed color. Devices lacking a 
;         DECOMPOSED keyword are assumed to be perpetually in indexed color mode.
;         The Z-graphics buffer is always unchanged after the 24 Dec 2011 update. 
;       
; :Keywords:
;     currentstate: out, optional, type=integer
;         The current decomposition state of the current graphics device when the
;         program is called. A 1 indicates decomposed color. A 0 indicates indexed 
;         color.
;     depth: out, optional, type=integer
;         The currnet pixel depth of the graphics device. 
;     zdepth: in, optional, type=integer
;         The pixel depth of the Z-graphics device. Set to 8 or 24. Applies ONLY 
;         when setting the Z-graphics device state to 0. If undefined, the current 
;         depth of the Z-graphics device is unchanged from its current state. No
;         longer used after 24 Dec 2011 update. Code still in place, however.
;          
; :Examples:
;     To set the device in color decomposition mode, then return it, do something like this::
;     
;        cgSetColorState, 1, CurrentState=theState
;        ...
;        cgSetColorState, theState

;     Change History::
;        Written, 16 November 2010. DWF.
;        Changes to include SET_PIXEL_DEPTH in Z-graphics buffer. 19 Nov 2010. DWF.
;        Allow PostScript 7.0 to set the decomposition keyword. 12 Dec 2010. DWF.
;        Added DEPTH and ZDEPTH keywords. 31 Dec 2010. DWF.
;        Added a do-nothing NULL device to Case statement. 4 Jan 2011. DWF.
;        Removed the Z-graphics buffer from control by this program. 24 Dec 2011. DWF.
;        Added back the ability to set decomposed state for the Z-buffer, but only
;           if the depth buffer is 24-bits or higher. 25 May 2012. DWF.
;        Renamed SetDecomposedState to cgSetColorState. 5 November 2013. DWF.
