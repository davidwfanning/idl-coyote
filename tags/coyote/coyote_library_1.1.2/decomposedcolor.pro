; NAME:
;  DECOMPOSEDCOLOR
;
; PURPOSE:
;
;   This function is used to determine, in a device independent way, if the 
;   current graphics device is using color decomposition. The function returns
;   a 1 if color decomposition is turned on, and a 0 if it is turned off. When
;   color decomposition is turned on, we say the device is using a true-color
;   display. If color decomposition is turned off, we say the device is using
;   an indexed color display.

; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;   result = DecomposedColor()
;
; RETURN VALUE:
;
;   result:       A 1 if color decomposition is turned on. A 0 if color decomposition is turned off.
;
; ARGUMENTS:
;
;  device:        The IDL graphics device whose color decomposition state you wish to know the
;                 current value of. If undefined, the current graphics device is used.
;
; KEYWORDRS:
;
;  DEPTH:          An output keyword that returns the depth of the graphics device. Normally,
;                  either 8 for index color devices, with color decomposition turned off, or 24
;                  for true-color devices with color decomposition turned on.
;
; EXAMPLE:
;
;  IDL> Print, DecomposedColor()     ; Color decomposition state of current graphics device.
;       1
;  IDL> Print, DecomposedColor('PS') ; Color decomposition state of PostScript graphics device.
;       0
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;
;  Written by: David W. Fanning, May 24, 2009.
;  Modified the way decomposition was obtained for PostScript devices IDL 7.1 and higher. 12 Dec 2010. DWF.
;  Fixed a problem in the CASE statement with ELSE clause and added a NULL device segment. 4 Jan 2011. DWF.
;  It now appears 24-bit PostScript support was added in IDL 7.1, although the Get_Decomposed keyword
;      didn't work until IDL 7.1.1. 13 January 2011. DWF
