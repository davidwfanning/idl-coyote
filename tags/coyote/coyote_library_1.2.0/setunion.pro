; CATEGORY:

;   Utilities
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;   union = SetUnion(set_a, set_b)
;
; RETURN VALUE:
;
;   union:  A vector of values that are found in the combined integer sets.
;
; ARGUMENTS:
;
;   set_a:         A vector of integers.
;   
;   set_b:         A vector of integers.
;
; KEYWORDRS:
;
;    None.
;    
; EXAMPLE:
;
;  IDL> set_a = [1,2,3,4,5]
;  IDL> set_b = [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]
;  IDL> Print, SetUnion(set_a, set_b)
;          1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11
;
;  See http://www.dfanning.com/tips/set_operations.html for other types of set operations.
;  
; NOTES:
; 
;  If you read the Set Operations article pointed to above, you will see quite a lot of
;  discussion about what kinds of algorithms are faster than others. The Histogram 
;  algorithms implemented here are sometimes NOT the fastest algorithms, especially 
;  for sparse arrays. If this is a concern in your application, please be sure to read
;  that article.
;  
;  One alternative for the SetUnion algorithm, provided by Maarten Sneep, is simply this:
;  
;      superset = [set_a, set_b]
;      union = superset[Uniq(superset, Sort(superset))]
;

;  Written by: David W. Fanning, November 25, 2009, from code originally supplied to the IDL
;     newsgroup by Research Systems software engineers.
