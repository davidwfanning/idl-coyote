; NAME:
;    DIRPATH
;
; PURPOSE:
;
;    The purpose of this function is to return a device-independent
;    name of a directory. It is similar to the IDL-supplied FILEPATH
;    routine, except that a file name is not required.

; INPUTS:
;
;    subDirectory:    This is a string argument containing the name of the
;                     sub-directory you wish to use. It can be a string
;                     array of sub-directory names. By default, the subDirectory
;                     is set to ['examples', 'data']. To only return the Root_Directory,
;                     set the subDirectory to a null string ("").
;
; KEYWORDS:
;
;    ROOT_DIRECTORY: The name of the root directory to use. By default,
;                    the root directory is set to !DIR.
;
; OUTPUTS:
;
;    The machine-independent directory path.
