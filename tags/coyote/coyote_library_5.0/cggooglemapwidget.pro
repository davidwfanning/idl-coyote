;
;+
; This is the driver for the cgGoogleMapWidget object, which is a compound widget
; object that obtains a Google static map from Google Maps and displays it in the
; program's draw widget window. It can be used either as a stand-alone program or
; to create a map image in draw widget in a larger widget program.
;
; This program implements a subset of the Google Static Map API, which can be found in
; more detail here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/. The 
; program works by building a URL for a map image. A connection to the Internet is 
; required to then request a map image (in GIF, JPEG or PNG format) to be returned from
; Google Maps. The returned image is then read and loaded into a draw widget window
; of the right size for the returned map image. The default is to delete the image file
; that is created, but the user can also set keywords to retain the image that is downloaded
; from Google Maps. Users are able to control button and motion events in the resulting
; draw widget with their own event handler module. A cgMap coordinate object is created
; to establish a map reference coordinate system on top of the returned map image, allowing
; other map information to be drawn on top of the returned map image.
;
; :Categories:
;    Graphics, Widgets
;    
; :Params:
;    parent: in, optional, type=long
;         The identifier of the parent widget of the draw widget that is going to be 
;         created by the program. If not provided, the program will create its own 
;         top-level base widget as the parent.
;       
; :Keywords:
;     box_axes: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;         Set this keyword to draw box axes around the Google Map.
;     button_events: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;         Set this keyword to turn button events on for the draw widget in the program.
;     center_latitude: in, optional, type=float, default=40.60
;         The center latitude of the requested Google map. If not provided, the latitude of
;         Fort Collins, Colorado, home of Coyote. Latitudes are only recognized to four
;         decimals values of precision.
;     center_longitude: in, optional, type=float, default=-105.10
;         The center longitude of the requested Google map. If not provided, the longitude of
;         Fort Collins, Colorado, home of Coyote. Longitude are only recognized to four
;         decimals values of precision.
;     event_method: in, optional, type='string'
;         The name of the event handler method for the draw widget. If you use this keyword,
;         you will also need to write this event handler module. It gets sent one positional
;         parameter, the event structure created by the draw widget.
;     event_pro: in, optional, type='string'
;         The name of an external event handler procedure for the draw widget. The event handler
;         procedure gets sent one positional parameter, the event structure created by the draw widget.
;     imagetype: in, optional, type=string, default='png32'
;         The type of image format the Google map should be returned in. The default is
;         a 32-bit full color PNG file. The image types are given in the Google Static Map
;         API documentation and are as follows: png or png8, png32, gif, jpg, and jpg-baseline.
;     keep_image: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;         Set this keyword if you wish to save the Google map as an image when the object
;         is destroyed.
;     maptype: in, optional, type=string, default='terrain'
;         Set this keyword to the type of map you wish to retrieve from Google Maps. The
;         choices are listed in the Google Static Map API documentation and are: "roadmap",
;         "terrain", "satellite", and "hybrid".
;     markers: in, optional, type=structure
;         A scalar or array of cgGoogleMapMarker structures. If present, the markers will
;         be requested with the map from Google. The cgGoogleMapMarker structure is defined
;         like this::
;            struct = { cgGOOGLEMAPMARKER, $
;               size: "", $         ; The marker size ("tiny", "small", "mid" or "normal")
;               color: "", $        ; A color name as provided by cgColor.
;               label: "", $        ; A single uppercase character label from the set {A-Z,0-9}.
;               lats: Ptr_New(), $  ; A pointer to one or more latitude values.
;               lons: Ptr_New() }   ; A pointer to one or more longitude values.
;         Note that the user will be responsible for freeing the pointers in the MARKERS
;         structure. This program will not do that.
;     motion_events: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;         Set this keyword to turn motion events on for the draw widget in the program.
;     tempDir: in, optional, type=string
;         The directory where the image containing the Google map is written. By default,
;         it is obtained from the environment like this: tempdir = GetEnv('IDL_TMPDIR').
;     visiblemarkers: in, optional, type=boolean, default=1
;         Set this keyword to 0 to temporarily turn off the display of the markers. Normally,
;         markers are drawn (if present), unless this flag is set to 0.
;     xsize: in, optional, type=int, default=600
;         The X size of the program's draw widget. A maximum of 690 if box axes are requested
;         and a maximum of 640 if no box axes are requested. Box axes require a 25 pixel border
;         and the maximum size of a Google Map is 640 pixels.
;     ysize: in, optional, type=int, default=600
;         The Y size of the program's draw widget. A maximum of 690 if box axes are requested
;         and a maximum of 640 if no box axes are requested. Box axes require a 25 pixel border
;         and the maximum size of a Google Map is 640 pixels.
;     zoomlevel: in, optional, type=integer, default=12
;         The zoom level of the requested Google map. Should be an integer between 0 and 21.
;
; :Returns:
;    The return value is an instance of a cgGoogleMapWidget object.
;    
; :Examples:
;    Used to put two markers on a map of Fort Collins, Colorado, in a stand-alone window::
;        PRO cgGoogleMapWidget_Test
;            marker1 = {cgGOOGLEMAPMARKER, 'normal', 'dodger blue', 'A', Ptr_New(40.600), Ptr_New(-105.100)}
;            marker2 = {cgGOOGLEMAPMARKER, 'normal', 'purple',      'B', Ptr_New(40.605), Ptr_New(-105.105)}
;            googleObject = cgGoogleMapWidget(MARKERS=[marker1, marker2], MAPTYPE='Terrain')
