; NAME:
;       FSC_NORMALIZE
;
; PURPOSE:
;
;       This is a utility routine to calculate the scaling vector
;       required to position a graphics primitive of specified range
;       at a specific position in an arbitray coordinate system. The
;       scaling vector is given as a two-element array like this:
;
;          scalingVector = [translationFactor, scalingFactor]
;
;       The scaling vector should be used with the [XYZ]COORD_CONV
;       keywords of a graphics object or model. For example, if you
;       wanted to scale an X axis into the coordinate range of -0.5 to 0.5,
;       you might type something like this:
;
;          xAxis->GetProperty, Range=xRange
;          xScale = FSC_Normalize(xRange, Position=[-0.5, 0.5])
;          xAxis, XCoord_Conv=xScale

; CATEGORY:

;       Object Graphics
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
; 
;       xscaling = FSC_NORMALIZE(xrange, POSITION=position)
;
; INPUTS:
; 
;       XRANGE: A two-element vector specifying the data range.
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
; 
;       POSITION: A two-element vector specifying the location
;       in the coordinate system you are scaling into. The vector [0,1]
;       is used by default if POSITION is not specified.
;
; COMMON BLOCKS:
; 
;       None.
;
; EXAMPLE:
; 
;       See above.

; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;       Written by:  David W. Fanning, OCT 1997.
;       Fixed a problem with illegal divide by zero. 21 April 2005. DWF.
;       Fixed a problem when range[0] is greater than range[1]. 11 July 2006. DWF.
;       Renamed to FSC_Normalize to avoid conflicts with 10,000 other programs named NORMALIZE. 17 October 2008. DWF.
