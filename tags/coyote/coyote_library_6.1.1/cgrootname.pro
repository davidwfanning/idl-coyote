; NAME:
;   cgRootName
;
; PURPOSE:
;    The purpose of this routine is to extract from a long file path the
;    base or root file name. That is, the name of the actual file without
;    the preceeding directory information or the final file extension.
;    The directory information and file extension can be obtained via
;    keywords. It is similar to File_Basename in IDL.

; The purpose of this routine is to extract from a long file path, the
; base or root file name. That is, the name of the actual file without

; The directory information and file extension can be obtained via
; keywords. It is similar to File_Basename in IDL.
;
; :Categories:
;    Utilities
;    
; :Returns: 
;      The base or root file name is returned. This is the "name" of the file
;      without either the preceeding directory information, or the prepended
;      file extension.
;      
; :Params:
;    filename: in, required, type=string
;        This file name to be parsed. It may be a relative or absolute path
;        name to a file.
;        
; :Keywords:
;     directory: out, optional, type=string
;         The name of the directory preceeding the root file name. If the file name
;         contains no directory information, this keyword is set equal to the current
;         working directory at the time the program is called.
;     extension: out, optional, type=string
;         The (usually!) three character file extention of the file.
;     path_separator: in, optional, type=string
;         The string to use as a path separator in parsing the file. If undefined
;         the out of Path_Sep() is used.
;
; :Examples:
;    Print, the root name, directory, and extension of a file::
;       IDL> thePath = "C:\rsi\idl7.8\lib\jester.pro"
;       IDL> Print, cgRootName(thePath, Directory=theDirectory, Extension=theExtension)
;           jester
;       IDL> Print, theDirectory
;            C:\rsi\idl7.8\lib\
;       IDL> Print, theExtension
;            pro
;            
;    Get the name of the current directory, with the path separator as the last character. This is
;    the equivalent of CD, Current=current & current = current + Path_Sep().
;       IDL> void = cgRootName(Directory=current)
;       IDL> Print, current

; :History:
;     Change History::
;        Written by: David W. Fanning, 31 July 2003.
;        Modified by KaRo, 13 Feb. 2005 to allow dots in the filename.
;        Added PATH_SEPARATOR keyword. 25 July 2005. DWF.
;        Added ability to recongnize directory by path separator in last character. 19 Sept 2005. DWF.
;        If directory is blank (because a relative filename was passed), set to current directory. 6 Aug 2009. DWF.
;        There were a couple of instances where the directory did NOT end in a path separator. Fixed. 24 Feb 2012. DWF.
;        Added ability to get the current directory with a path separator in one step instead of two. See example
;           section for details. 26 Sept 2013. DWF.
