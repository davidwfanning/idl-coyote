; NAME:
;   cgPixmap
;
; PURPOSE:
;   Creates an invisible graphics window for IDL traditional commands (Plot, Contour, 
;   Surface, etc. or for Coyote Graphics routines, cgPlot, cgContour, cgSurf, etc.). 
;   In addition, the window contents can be saved as PostScript files or as raster image 
;   files. If ImageMagick is installed on your machine, the raster image files can be 
;   created in very high quality from PostScript files. This window is identical to
;   cgWindow, except that it doesn't appear on the display, unless you want it to.

;+
;  Creates an invisible graphics window for IDL traditional commands (Plot, Contour, 
;  Surface, etc. or for Coyote Graphics routines, cgPlot, cgContour, cgSurf, etc.). 
;  In addition, the window contents can be saved as PostScript files or as raster image 
;  files. If ImageMagick is installed on your machine, the raster image files can be 
;  created in very high quality from PostScript files. This window is identical to
;  cgWindow, except that it doesn't appear on the display unless you want it to.
;
;  The program is designed to work with any IDL traditional graphics routine
;  that is a procedure and includes no more than three positional parameters.
;  Any number of keywords can be used to specify properties of the graphical
;  output. Any number of graphics commands can be "added" the the cgWindow.
;  Simply use the `AddCmd` keyword to add commands.
;  
;  If your program does not load its own color tables, the color tables in
;  effect when cgWindow is first called are used to display the graphics
;  commands.
;    
;  To create PostScript output from within cgWindow, your graphics program
;  has to be written in such a way that it can work properly in the PostScript
;  device. This means there are no Window commands, WSet commands, and the like
;  that are not allowed in the PostScript device. Such commands are allowed in 
;  programs, of course, if they are "protected". Usually such protection looks 
;  like this::
;  
;     IF (!D.Flags AND 256) NE 0 THEN Window, ...
;     
;  The Coyote Graphics program `cgDisplay` is a good program for opening graphics 
;  "windows", because such PostScript protection is built into the program. In a PostScript 
;  device, cgDisplay produces a "window" with the same aspect ratio as the current
;  display graphics window, which is an aid in producing PostScript output that
;  looks like the same output in the display window.
;   
;  Much better looking raster files can be created from the cgWindow contents,
;  if the raster files are created by converting PostScript files to the raster 
;  file. If the ImageMagick "convert" command can be found on your machine, you
;  will have the option to create raster files using this method. I *highly*
;  recommend doing so, as fonts and other plot annotation will be of much higher
;  quality using this method.
;   
;  cgWindow has been designed to work with other Coyote Graphics routines: `cgPlot`,
;  `cgContour`, `cgSurf`, and so on, although I expect it to work with any IDL
;  traditional graphics routine, if the routine is well written.
;        
;  Default properties of the object can be controled with cgWindow_SetDefs and cgControl,
;  as with cgWindow. Be sure to delete the pixmap object when you are done with it, by
;  using (for example) cgDelete.

;
; :Params:
;    command: in, required, type=string
;       The graphics procedure command to be executed. This parameter
;       must be a string and the the command must be a procedure. Examples
;       are 'Surface', 'Contour', 'Plot', 'cgPlot', cgContour, etc.
;    p1: in, optional, type=any
;       The first positional parameter appropriate for the graphics command.
;    p2: in, optional, type=any
;       The second positional parameter appropriate for the graphics command.
;    p3: in, optional, type=any
;       The third positional parameter appropriate for the graphics command.
;    p4: in, optional, type=any
;       The fourth positional parameter appropriate for the graphics command.
;       
; :Keywords:
;    addcmd: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;       Set this keyword to add an additional graphics command to an cgWindow.
;       The command is added to the last created cgWindow, unless the WinID
;       keyword is used to select another cgWindow. Adding a command causes
;       all the commands in the window to be immediately executed. If this is
;       not behavior you desire, use the LOADCMD keyword instead. If CMDINDEX
;       is used to select a command index, the new command is added before
;       the command currently occuping that index in the command list.
;    altps_Keywords: in, optional, type=string
;       A structure containing alternative keyword names (as tags) and values for
;       those keywords to be used when the current device is the PostScript device.
;       See http://www.idlcoyote.com/cg_tips/kwexpressions.php and the examples
;       below for details on how to use this keyword.
;    altps_Params: in, optional, type=IntArr(3)
;       A structure containing alternative parameter values to be used when 
;       the current device is the PostScript device. Structure names are restricted
;       to the names "P1", "P2", "P3" and "P4" to correspond to the equivalent positional
;       parameter. See http://www.idlcoyote.com/cg_tips/kwexpressions.php and the 
;       examples below for details on how to use this keyword.
;    cmddelay: in, optional, type=float
;       Ignored. Used only for compatibility with cgWindow.
;    cmdindex: in, optional, type=integer
;       This keyword is used to select which command in an cgWindow to act on
;       when the AllCmd, DeleteCmd, LoadCmd and ReplaceCmd keywords are used. 
;       See the descriptions of these keywords for details on what happens when 
;       CmdIndex is missing.
;    deletecmd: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;       Set this keyword to delete a graphics command from an cgWindow.
;       If CmdIndex is undefined the last command entered into the window is
;       deleted. It is not possible to delete the last command in the window.
;       Use WinID to identify the cgWindow you are interested in. If WinID 
;       is undefined, the last cgWindow created is used.
;    executecmd: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;       Set this keyword to immediate execute all the commands in an cgWindow.
;       Normally, this is used after commands have been loaded with LOADCMD.
;    group_leader: in, optional
;       The identifier of a widget to serve as a group leader for this program.
;       If the group leader is destroyed, this program is also destroyed. Used
;       when calling this program from another widget program.
;    listcmd: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;       If this keyword is set, the commands currently in the cgWindow are
;       listed. Use WinID to identify the cgWindow you are interested in.
;       If WinID is undefined, the last cgWindow created is used.
;    loadcmd: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;       Set this keyword to add an additional graphics command to an cgWindow.
;       The command is added to the last created cgWindow, unless the WinID
;       keyword is used to select another cgWindow. Loaded commands are not
;       automatically executed. Set the EXECUTECMD keyword at the end of loading
;       to execute the loaded commands. If CMDINDEX is used to select a command 
;       index, the new command is loaded before the command currently occuping 
;       that index in the command list.
;    method: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;       Set this keyword if the command is an object method call rather than a 
;       procedure call. If this keyword is set, the first positional parameter, p1,
;       must be present and must be a valid object reference.
;    replacecmd: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;       Set this keyword to replace a graphics command from an cgWindow.
;       If CmdIndex is undefined, *all* commands in the window are replaced. Use 
;       WinID to identify the cgWindow you are interested in. If WinID is 
;       undefined, the last cgWindow created is used for the replacement.
;    waspect: in, optional, type=float, default=normal
;       Set this keyword to the aspect ratio you would like the window to have.
;       The aspect ratio is calculated as (ysize/xsize). Must be a float value.
;       If this keyword is set, the window will maintain this aspect ratio,
;       even when it is resized.
;    wbackground: in, optional, type=varies, default=!P.Background
;       The background color of the window. Specifying a background color 
;       automatically sets the WErase keyword.
;    wdestroyobjects: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;       If this keyword is set, and any of the input parameters p1-p4 is an object,
;       the object parameter will be destroyed when the window is destroyed.
;    werase: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;       Set this keyword to cause the window to be erased before graphics commands 
;       are drawn. This may need to be set, for example, to display images.
;    winid: in, optional, type=integer
;       Use this keyword to select the window cgWindow identifier (the number between
;       the parentheses in the title bar of cgWindow). The AddCmd, ReplaceCmd, ListCmd,
;       and DeleteCmd keywords will all apply to the commands in the last cgWindow
;       created unless this keyword is used to select another cgWindow to apply the 
;       commands to.
;    wmulti: in, optional, type=intarr(5)
;        Set this keyword in exactly the same way you would set the !P.Multi keyword.
;        It will allow you to display multi-plots in the cgWindow graphics window.
;    wobject: out, optional, type=object
;       cgWindow creates a FSC_CmdWindow object. This object reference is returned
;       if this keyword is present.
;    woxmargin: in, optional, type=float
;       A two-element array indicating the left and right X outside margins for the
;       graphical display. Used only when doing multiple plots with `WMulti`.
;    woymargin: in, optional, type=float
;       A two-element array indicating the bottom and top Y outside margins for the
;       graphical display. Used only when doing multiple plots with `WMulti`.
;    wxpos: in, optional, type=integer, default=5
;       Ignored. Used only for compatibility with cgWindow.
;    wypos: in, optional, type=integer, default=5
;       Ignored. Used only for compatibility with cgWindow.
;    wxsize: in, optional, type=integer, default=640
;       The x size in device coordinates of the graphics window.
;    wysize: in, optional, type=integer, default=5
;       The y size in device coordinates of the the graphics window.
;    wtitle: in, optional, type=string, default='Resizeable Graphics Window'
;       Ignored. Used only for compatibility with cgWindow.
;          
; :Examples:
;    Test code::
;       data = cgDemoData(17)
;       pixmap = cgPixmap()
;       cgPlot, data, COLOR='red', /Window
;       cgPlot, data, PSYM=2, /Overplot, COLOR='dodger blue', /AddCmd
;       cgPlot, cgDemoData(17), color='olive', linestyle = 2, /Overplot, /AddCmd
;       pixmap = cgPixmap(/ListCmd)
;       pixmap = cgPixmap('cgPlot', data, COLOR='purple', /ReplaceCMD, CMDINDEX=0)
;       pixmap -> Output, 'myplot.png'
;       
;    Example using different keyword parameters for the display and PostScript output::
;    
;       pixmap = cgPixmap('cgPlot', cgDemoData(1), $
;             THICK=1.0, XTITLE='Distance (' + cgGreek('mu') + 'm)', $
;             ALTPS_KEYWORDS={THICK:4.0, XTITLE:'Distance (' + cgGreek('mu', /PS) + 'm)'})
;           
;    Example using different positional parameters::
;    
;       pixmap = cgPixmap('cgText', 0.20, 0.85, /Normal, 'Line of Text', ALIGNMENT=0.0, $
;             ALTPS_KEYWORDS={ALIGNMENT:1.0}, ALTPS_PARAMS={P1:0.88})
;             
;    Example copying pixmap contents to a normal IDL graphics window::
;
