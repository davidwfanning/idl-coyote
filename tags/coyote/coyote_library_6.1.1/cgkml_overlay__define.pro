;   This program implements the KML abstract OVERLAY class. For 
;   reference, see  the `Google KML Reference Documentation <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#overlay>`.
;   An Overlay object is a basic KML class, and should be inherited by,
;   for example, a cgKML_GroundOverlay object, which extends and implements 
;   this KML abstract class.

; :Keywords:
;     color: in, optional, type=string
;         Color values are expressed in hexadecimal notation, including opacity (alpha) values. 
;         The order of expression is alpha, blue, green, red (aabbggrr). The range of values for 
;         any one color is 0 to 255 (00 to ff). For opacity, 00 is fully transparent and ff is 
;         fully opaque. For example, if you want to apply a blue color with 50 percent opacity 
;         to an overlay, you would specify the following: COLOR = "7fff0000".
;     draworder: in, optional, type=integer
;         This element defines the stacking order for the images in overlapping overlays. 
;         Overlays with higher values are drawn on top of overlays with lower values.
;     href: in, optional, type=string
;         A URL that identifies the location of the image associated with this Overlay. The
;         location can be either a local file (e.g., 'myimage.png') or a URL to an image
;         on a web server (e.g., 'http://www.idlcoyote.com/images/myimage.png').
