;+
;  The purpose of this program is allow interactive inquiry of image
;  position and values for images displayed with cgImage.
;  After a call to cgImage, cgImageInfo can be called and the user
;  can use the cursor to click in the image display window. If the user clicks
;  inside the image, the image location and value will be printed out in the
;  user's IDL console window. The cgImageInfo program blocks the IDL command 
;  line until the RIGHT mouse button is clicked in the image display window.
;  
;  This cgImageInfo program is designed to work for the last image displayed with cgImage 
;  on a Windows or X device. Precautions are taken to help you avoid shooting
;  yourself in the foot, but I can't anticipate every action a user might take at the 
;  IDL command line. Pay particular attention to exiting the program with the RIGHT mouse
;  button before you close or kill the current graphics window. Failure to do so will 
;  put you into a very strange and precarious state from which no rescue is possible.
;  You might want to consider using the Catalyst Program `IMGWIN <http://www.idlcoyote.com/catalyst/imgwin.html>`
;   as an alternative to cgImageInfo.
;
; :Categories:
;    Graphics
;    
; :Params:
;    image: in, required, 
;         A 2D or 3D image array. Values will be returned from this image.
;         In versions of IDL < 8.0, it is possible to use a HASH object of
;         keys/images where this program will describe the value for each of
;         the images in the HASH object.
;    position: in, optional, type=float
;         A four-element floating array giving the position of the image in
;         the display window. If not provided, the image position will be
;         retrieved from the last image position used with cgImage.
;         
; :Examples:
;     To display an image with axes and then inquire about it::
;
;         filename = FILEPATH(SUBDIR=['examples','data'], 'worldelv.dat')
;         image = BYTARR(360,360)
;         OPENR, lun, filename, /GET_LUN
;         READU, lun, image
;         FREE_LUN, lun
;
;         thisPosition = [0.1, 0.1, 0.9, 0.9]
;         cgImage, image, /KEEP_ASPECT,  POSITION=thisPosition, /AXES

; :History:
;     Change History::
;      Written by: David W Fanning, 16 March 2008.
;      Added ability to specify position directly in call. 20 March 2008. DWF
;      Changed cursor operation to conform with expected differences
;         between Windows and UNIX. 20 March 2008, DWF.
;      Slightly modified screen directions. 16 November 2010. DWF.
;      Modified so that multiple images/grids can be described 18 May 2011. MHS
