; NAME:
;   SDEVSCL
;
; PURPOSE:
;    This is a utility routine to perform standard deviation scaling
;    on image arrays. The user defines a multiple of the standard
;    deviation and this is used with the standard deviation of the
;    pixels in the image to create a threshold for linear scaling.
;    Use the EXCLUDE keyword to exclude a particular value from
;    the standard deviation calculation.

; :Categories:
;    Utilities, Graphics
;    
; :Params:
;     image: in, required, type=numeric
;        The image array that is to be scaled.
;      
; :Keywords:
;     exclude: in, optional, type=numeric
;         Set this keyword to a value in the image array that is to be excluded from the
;         standard deviation calculation. Normally, this would be the backgroud value of
;         the image, if there is a background.
;     multiplier: in, optional, type=float, default=2.0
;        The standard deviation of the image pixels is computed and then
;        multiplied by the multiplier factor to produce upper and lower
;        thresholds for the linear scaling of the image by subtracting
;        or adding this value to the mean value of the image. The image
;        is linearly scaled between these two threshold values. 
;     negative: in, optional, type=boolean
;          Set this keyword to return the "negative" or reverse of the image scaling.
;     omax: in, optional, type=byte, default=255
;          Normally, the image is scaled into the range of 0 to 255. Setting the
;          OMIN and OMAX keywords can change this scaling.
;     omin: in, optional, type=byte, default=0
;          Normally, the image is scaled into the range of 0 to 255. Setting the
;          OMIN and OMAX keywords can change this scaling.
;     threshold: out, optional, type=float
;          A two-element array that contains the minimum and maximum thresholds, respectively,
;          that were calculated for the scaling.
;              
; :Examples:
;     To display an image with standard deviation scaling::
;        image = cgDemoData(5)
;        cgDisplay, 256*3, 256
;        !P.Multi = [0,3,1]
;        cgImage, image
;        cgImage, SDevScl(image)
;        cgImage, SDevScl(image, Exclude=0)
;        !P.Multi = 0
