; NAME:
;  cgSnake
;
; PURPOSE:
;  This function applies the Gradient Vector Flow active contour algorithm, as described by
;  Chenyang Xu and Jerry L. Prince in "Snakes, Shapes, and Gradient Vector Flow" in the March
;  1998 IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, Vol. 7, No.3. Additional information,
;  including references to research papers, is available via Cheyang Xu's web page:
;  http://iacl.ece.jhu.edu/projects/gvf/.
;
;  Active contours are often described as "snakes" because they writhe and move
;  under the influence of external and internal forces, toward a feature of interest
;  in an image, usually an edge. This program gives the user the opportunity
;  to control both external and internal forces to find an optimal set of active contour
;  parameters. Active contours are most often used with images to find and describe
;  regions of interest.

; :Returns:
;     The function returns an ROI structure containing the deformed points of the final contour
;     in addition to other information. The return structure looks like this::
;     
;        roiStruct = { npts: 0L  ; The length of the X and Y fields in the structure.
;                      x:   0.0  ; The X values (in image coordinates) of the final contour.
;                      y:   0.0  ; The Y values (in image coordinates) of the final contour.
;                      perimeter:  0.0 ; The perimenter length of the ROI.
;                      area: 0.0 ; The area enclosed by the ROI.
;                      values:   ; A vector of length npts, giving the value of the image at (x,y).
;                     }

;
; :Params:
;     image: in, required
;        The image for which the active contour (snake) will be applied.
;        This argument must be 2D. The user will be asked to select an
;        image file if this argument is not provided.
;     x_init: in, required, type=float
;        The initial X points of the active contour or snake. Must be paired with Y. 
;        Assume values are pixel locations within image.
;     y_init: in, required, type=float
;        The initial Y points of the active contour or snake. Must be paired with X. 
;        Assume values are pixel locations within image.
;       
;
; :Keywords:
;     alpha: in, optional, type=float, default=0.10
;        The elasticity parameter of the active contour. It reflects the contour's
;        ability to stretch along its length.
;     beta: in, optional, type=float, default=0.25
;        The rigidity parameter of the active contour. It reflects the contour's
;        ability to bend, as, for example, around corners.
;     blur: in, optional, type=boolean, default=1
;        Set this keyword to 1 if you want a Gaussian Blur applied to image before
;        processing. Set it to 0 otherwise.
;     delta_max: in, optional, type=float, default=5.50
;        The maximum pixel distance for adaptive interpolation.
;     delta_min: in, optional, type=float, default=0.25
;        The minimum pixel distance for adaptive interpolation.
;     gamma: in, optional, type=float, default=1.0
;        The viscosity parameter. Larger values make it harder to deform the active
;        contour in space.
;     gradientscale: in, optional, type=float, default=1.75
;        A multiplication factor for the gradient calculations.
;     kappa: in, optional, type=float, default=1.25
;        The external force weight.
;     gvf_iterations: in, optional, type=integer, default=30
;        The number of iterations for calculating the Gradient Vector Flow (GVF).
;     iterations: in, optional, type=integer, default=120
;        The number of iterations to use in calculating the snake positions.
;     max_value: in, optional, type=varies
;        The maximum value for scaling the image data to create contrast for the edge mask.
;     min_value: in, optional, type=varies
;        The minimum value for scaling the image data to create contrast for the edge mask.
;     mu: in, optional, type=float, default=0.10
;        The regularization parameter. This should be set according to the amount of
;        noise in the image. Use a larger value for noisier images.
;     parameterfile: in, optional, type=string
;        The name of a parameter file created with the ActiveContour program and containing
;        most of the snake parameters set here with other keywords.
;     sigma: in, optional, type=float, default=1.0
;        The standard deviation or sigma of the Gaussian function used in Gaussian
;        blurring.
;     spatial_scale: in, optional, type=double, default=1.0D
;        Set this keyword to a two-element array that specifies the pixel scale in
;        the X and Y directions ([xscale, yscale]). The scale factors are applied
;        when the perimeter and area calculations for the final contour is made.
;        Default is [1.0D, 1.0D].
