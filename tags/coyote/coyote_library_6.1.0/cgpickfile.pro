; NAME:
;   cgPickfile
;
; PURPOSE:
;   This is a utility program for selecting data files. It is a wrapper for DIALOG_PICKFILE, 
;   with the additional functionality of being able to "remember" the name and directory of 
;   the last file selected by the program. It basically allows you to start the next file 
;   selection from the location of the previous file selection.

;
; :Categories:
;    Utility
;    
; :Returns:
;    The fully-qualified name of the selected file or a null string if the CANCEL 
;    button was selected.
;    
; :Keywords:
;     datadir: in, optional, type=string
;         Set this keyword to the name of the data directory. If not set, the program 
;         assumes the data directory is rooted in the directory that holds this program 
;         file, or the directory directly above it. If it can't find a "data" directory 
;         in either of these two locations, the current directory is used as the "data" 
;         directory. The data directory is ONLY used if there is no "current" last 
;         directory. In other words, it is only used if cgPickfile has not been called 
;         in the current IDL session.
;     demo: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0 
;         If set, starts in the !DIR/examples/data directory.
;     jpeg: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0  
;         If set, starts in the "jpeg" directory. It assumes the jpeg directory is rooted 
;         in the "data" directory.
;     hdf: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0 
;         If set, starts in the "hdf" directory. It assumes the hdf directory is rooted 
;         in the "data" directory.
;     last_file: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0  
;         If set, the name of the last file opened is placed in the filename widget.
;     lidar: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0 
;         If set, starts in the "lidar" directory. It assumes the lidar directory is 
;         rooted in the "data" directory.
;     ncdf: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0 
;         If set, starts in the "ncdf" directory. It assumes the ncdf directory is 
;         rooted in the "data" directory.
;     png: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0 
;         If set, starts in the "png" directory. It assumes the png directory is 
;         rooted in the "data" directory.
;     tiff: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0 
;         If set, starts in the "tiff" directory. It assumes the tiff directory is 
;         rooted in the "data" directory.
;     title: in, optional, type=string, default="Please Select a File"
;         The title for the selection dialog window. If the `Write` keyword is set,
;         the default title becomes "Please Select a File for Writing".
;    write: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;         Set this keyword to change the default title to "Please Select a File for Writing".
;     _ref_extra: in, optional
;          Accepts any input keywords to DIALOG_PICKFILE (e.g., FILTER).
