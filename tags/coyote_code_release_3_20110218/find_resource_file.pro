; NAME:
;  FIND_RESOURCE_FILE
;
; PURPOSE:
;
;  This function is designed to search for and return the fully qualified
;  path to a resource file. The order of search is as follows:
;
;    1. In the directories rooted at the IDL resource directory (IDL_DIR/resource).
;    2. In the same directory as this file is found in.
;    3. In the directories rooted at a resource directory found in the same directory this file is in.
;    4. In the directories rooted at a resource directory found in the a directory one above the directory this file is in.
;    5. Anywhere in the IDL PATH. Note that a *.pro file *must* be in a directory for the directory to be on
;       the IDL PATH.

; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;  fullPath = Find_Resource_File(resourceFilename)
;
; INPUTS:
;
;  resourceFilename:   The root name of a resource file. For example, 'arc.bmp'.
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;
;  SUCCESS:            An output keyword whose value is set to 1 if the program
;                      successfully finds the resource file. Otherwise, set to 0.
;                      
;  VERBOSE:            Set this keyword to enable output that prints the full path 
;                      to the resource file, or tells you that the file cannot be found.
;
; RETURN_VALUE:
;
;  fullpath:           A fully-qualified file path to the resource file.
;
; EXAMPLE:
;
;  IDL> print, find_resource_file('gshhs_i.b', success=s) & print, 'success: ', s
;       /home/fanning/IDL/incubator/gshhs_i.b
;       success:            1
;  IDL> print, find_resource_file('dataviewer_splash.jpg', success=s) & print, 'success: ', s
;       /home/fanning/IDL/dataviewer/resources/dataviewer_splash.jpg
;       success:            1
;  IDL> print, find_resource_file('arc.bmp', success=s) & print, 'success: ', s
;       /usr/local/rsi/idl70/resource/bitmaps/arc.bmp
;       success:            1
;  IDL> print, find_resource_file('toast_and_jam.txt', success=s) & print, 'success: ', s
;
;      success:            0
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;
;  Written by: David W Fanning, December 12, 2008.
;  It seems all my resource files are in "resources" directories, not  "resource" directories.
;     So now the program looks in both places. 6 January 2009.
;  The file did not seem to be looking in the IDL path. It does now. 21 April 2010. DWF.
;  The file will also look in the directory of the caller of this program. 21 April 2010. DWF.
;  Fixed a problem when File_Search finds several files with the same name. Always takes the
;      first file found now. 4 June 2010. DWF.
