; NAME:
;   PS_END
;
; PURPOSE:
;
;    The purpose of PS_START and PS_END is to make it easy to set-up
;    for and close a PostScript file. The programs work in close conjunction
;    with PSCONFIG, another program from the Coyote Library.
;
;    If ImageMagick  (http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) is installed 
;    on your computer, you can easily convert PostScript output to JPEG, PNG, and TIFF
;    image output. (See the keywords to PS_END.)

; CATEGORY:
;
;       Graphics, File Output, PostScript
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;       PS_START
;       Various graphics commands here...
;       PS_END
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS FOR PS_END:
;
;      All keywords for PS_END require that ImageMagick is installed on your computer
;      and is configured correctly. Image conversion is done by spawning a "convert" 
;      command to ImageMagick.
;
;       ALLOW_TRANSPARENT: To make the background of some image files white, rather than transparent,
;                     you have to set the "-alpha off" string in the ImageMagick call. This
;                     string is automatically added to the ImageMagick call unless this keyword
;                     is set, in which case the string is not added and the image background will
;                     be transparent.  (See RESTRICTIONS note below for more information.) 
;
;       DENSITY:      The horizontal and vertical density of the image when the PostScript file
;                     is converted to an image format by ImageMagick. By default, 300. Use this
;                     keyword to set another value.
;                     
;       GIF:          Set this keyword to convert the PostScript output file to a GIF image.
;
;       JPEG:         Set this keyword to convert the PostScript output file to a JPEG image.
;       
;       NOFIX:        If this keyword is set, then the FixPS program to fix IDL landscape
;                     PostScript files is not called.
;
;       PNG:          Set this keyword to convert the PostScript output file to a PNG image.
;
;       IM_OPTIONS:   A string of ImageMagick "convert" options that can be passed to
;                     the  ImageMagick convert command. By default, a null string. No
;                     error checking occurs with this string.
;
;       RESIZE:       If an image is being created from the PostScript file, it is often 
;                     resized by some amount. The default value is 25 percent. You can use 
;                     this keyword to change the value to some other amount (e.g, RESIZE=100).
;                     The value is passed on to resize argument as a percentage in the 
;                     ImageMagick call.
;
;       TIFF:         Set this keyword to convert the PostScript output file to a TIFF image.
;       
;       The convert command looks like this. You can modify it in the code if you want it to
;       do something else for you.
;       
;          convert inputPostScriptFilename -resize 50% -density 300 -alpha off outputImageFilename 
;
; COMMON BLOCKS:
;
;       _$FSC_PS_START_   Contains the PS_STRUCT structure for communication between
;                         PS_START and PS_END.
;
; SIDE EFFECTS:
;
;       When PS_START is called, the current graphics device is set to "PS" (the PostScript 
;       device). When PS_END is called the current graphics device is returned to the device
;       in effect when PS_START was called.
;
; RESTRICTIONS:
;
;       Requires numerous programs from the Coyote Library. To convert PostScript files
;       to PNG, JPEG, and TIFF files requires ImageMagick be installed on your
;       computer and configured correctly. You can download Coyote Library programs here:
;
;             http://www.dfanning.com/programs/coyoteprograms.zip
;
;       ImageMagick can be found here:
;
;              http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php
;              
;       NOTE: In this version of PS_END, I have added the "alpha" option to the ImageMagick
;       command. This is a relatively recent addition to the convert command. (Added in ImageMagick
;       version 6.3.4). I believe PS_END can discover which version of ImageMagick you are useing
;       and act accordingly, but if it can't, set this alpha option to your liking. 
;
; EXAMPLE:
;
;       To create a line plot in a PostScript file named lineplot.ps and
;       also create a PNG file named lineplot.png for display in a browser,
;       type these commands.
;
;       PS_Start, FILENAME='lineplot.ps'
;       Plot, Findgen(11), COLOR=FSC_Color('navy'), /NODATA, XTITLE='Time', YTITLE='Signal'
;       OPlot, Findgen(11), COLOR=FSC_Color('indian red')
;       OPlot, Findgen(11), COLOR=FSC_Color('olive'), PSYM=2
;       PS_End, /PNG
;
; NOTES:
;
;       You can easily configure any modifications you like for your PostScript output
;       by setting fields in the plot and axis system variables (!P, !X, !Y, and !Z).
;       The modifications currently made by default in this program are these:
;
;          !P.Thick = 2
;          !X.Thick = 2
;          !Y.Thick = 2
;          !Z.Thick = 2
;          !P.Font = 1
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;
;       Written by: David W. Fanning, 20 May 2008.
;       Slight modification to allow filenames with spaces in them.
;       Added NoMatch keyword. 17 March 2009. DWF.
;       Added a number of keywords to make these commands more configurable. 19 March 2009. DWF.
;       Only set thickness system variables if starting system variables are set to their
;           default values (namely, 0). This allows users to set their own system variables
;           before they call PS_START, rather than after. 23 March  2009. DWF.
;       Moved PS_END to its own file to allow the IDLExBr_Assistant to work properly. 7 April 2009. DWF.
;       Reordered ImageMagick commands to put them in the proper sequence to get "alpha" switch to work. 23 April 2009. DWF.
;       Put the switches *ahead* of the PostScript file name. Now resizing works and default size reduction
;           returned to 25%. 23 April 2009. DWF.
;       Still having a devil of a time getting the ImageMagick "convert" command right. Fonts
;           have become a problem. Now trying a "flatten" option in the command. 12 May 2009. DWF.
;       If the PostScript file is in Landscape mode, it is now "fixed" with FixPS to allow it
;           to be displayed right-side up in PostScript viewers. 8 August 2009. DWF.
;       Fixed a problem in not checking the GIF keyword properly. 4 December 2009. DWF.
;       Added NOFIX keyword to the program. 1 November 2010. DWF.
;       Added better handing of errors coming from FIXPS after update to FIXPS. 15 November 2010. DWF.
