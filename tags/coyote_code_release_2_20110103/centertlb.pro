; NAME:
;       CENTERTLB
;
; PURPOSE:
;
;       This is a utility routine to position a widget program
;       on the display at an arbitrary location. By default the
;       widget is centered on the display.

; CATEGORY:

;       Utilities
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;       CenterTLB, tlb, [x, y, /NOCENTER, /DEVICE]
;
; REQUIRED INPUTS:
;
;       tlb: The top-level base identifier of the widget program. This must
;       be a valid widget ID.
;
; OPTIONAL INPUTS:
;
;       x:  Set this equal to a normalized position for the center
;       of the widget as measured from the left-hand side of the screen.
;       The default value is 0.5 (the center)  Setting this equal to 1.0
;       places the widget at the far right-hand side of the screen.
;
;       y:  Set this equal to a normalized position for the center
;       of the widget as measured from the bottom of the screen.
;       The default value is 0.5 (the center) Setting this equal to 1.0
;       places the widget at the top of the screen.
;
; KEYWORDS:
;
;      DEVICE:  Normally, the x and y parameters are specified in normalized
;      coordinates. If this keyword is set, they are taken to be in DEVICE
;      coordinates.
;
;      NOCENTER:  By default, the center of the widget is positioned at the
;      location specified by the x and y parameters.  If NOCENTER is set
;      to a non-zero value, then the upper left corner of the widget
;      is postioned at the specifed location.
;
; PROCEDURE:
;
;       The program should be called after all the widgets have
;       been created, but just before the widget hierarchy is realized.
;       It uses the top-level base geometry along with the display size
;       to calculate offsets for the top-level base that will center the
;       top-level base on the display.
;
; COMMENT:
;       Regardless of the values set for x, y and NOCENTER, the widget
;       is not permitted to run off the display.
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;
;       Written by:  Dick Jackson, 12 Dec 98.
;       Modified to use device-independent Get_Screen_Size
;            function. 31 Jan 2000. DWF.
;       Added x, y, NOCENTER and run-off protection. 26 Jan 2001. BT.
;       Added a maximum value of 1280 for X screen size. This helps
;            center the widget on a single monitor when using dual
;            monitor settings with some graphics cards. 3 Feb 2003. DWF.
;       Added DEVICE keyword. 4 January 2006. DWF.
