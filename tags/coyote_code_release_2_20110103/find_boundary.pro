; NAME:
;       FIND_BOUNDARY
;
; PURPOSE:
;
;       This program finds the boundary points about a region of interest (ROI)
;       represented by pixel indices. It uses a "chain-code" algorithm for finding
;       the boundary pixels.

; CATEGORY:
;
;       Graphics, math.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;       boundaryPts = Find_Boundary(indices, XSize=xsize, YSize=ysize)
;
; OPTIONAL INPUTS:
;
;       indices - A 1D vector of pixel indices that describe the ROI. For example,
;            the indices may be returned as a result of the WHERE function.
;
; OUTPUTS:
;
;       boundaryPts - A 2-by-n points array of the X and Y points that describe the
;            boundary. The points are scaled if the SCALE keyword is used.
;
; INPUT KEYWORDS:
;
;       SCALE - A one-element or two-element array of the pixel scale factors, [xscale, yscale],
;            used to calculate the perimeter length or area of the ROI. The SCALE keyword is
;            NOT applied to the boundary points. By default, SCALE=[1,1].
;
;       XSIZE - The X size of the window or array from which the ROI indices are taken.
;            Set to !D.X_Size by default.
;
;       YSIZE - The Y size of the window or array from which the ROI indices are taken.
;            Set to !D.Y_Size by default.
;
; OUTPUT KEYWORDS:
;
;       AREA - A named variable that contains the pixel area represented by the input pixel indices,
;            scaled by the SCALE factors.
;
;       CENTER - A named variable that contains a two-element array containing the center point or
;            centroid of the ROI. The centroid is the position in the ROI that the ROI would
;            balance on if all the index pixels were equally weighted. The output is a two-element
;            floating-point array in device coordinate system, unless the SCALE keyword is used,
;            in which case the values will be in the scaled coordinate system.
;
;       PERIM_AREA - A named variable that contains the (scaled) area represented by the perimeter
;            points, as indicated by John Russ in _The Image Processing Handbook, 2nd Edition_ on
;            page 490. This is the same "perimeter" that is returned by IDLanROI in its
;            ComputeGeometry method, for example. In general, the perimeter area will be
;            smaller than the pixel area.
;
;       PERIMETER - A named variable that will contain the perimeter length of the boundary
;            upon returning from the function, scaled by the SCALE factors.
;
;  EXAMPLE:
;
;       LoadCT, 0, /Silent
;       image = BytArr(400, 300)+125
;       image[125:175, 180:245] = 255B
;       indices = Where(image EQ 255)
;       Window, XSize=400, YSize=300
;       TV, image
;       PLOTS, Find_Boundary(indices, XSize=400, YSize=300, Perimeter=length), $
;           /Device, Color=FSC_Color('red')
;       Print, length
;           230.0
;
; DEPENDENCIES:
;
;       Requires ERROR_MESSAGE from the Coyote Library.

;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;
;       Written by David W. Fanning, April 2002. Based on an algorithm written by Guy
;       Blanchard and provided by Richard Adams.
;       Fixed a problem with distinction between solitary points and
;          isolated points (a single point connected on a diagonal to
;          the rest of the mask) in which the program can't get back to
;          the starting pixel. 2 Nov 2002. DWF
;       Added the ability to return the perimeter length with PERIMETER and
;           SCALE keywords. 2 Nov 2002. DWF.
;       Added AREA keyword to return area enclosed by boundary. 2 Nov 2002. DWF.
;       Fixed a problem with POLYFILLV under-reporting the area by removing
;           POLYFILLV and using a pixel counting method. 10 Dec 2002. DWF.
;       Added the PERIM_AREA and CENTER keywords. 15 December 2002. DWF.
;       Replaced the ERROR_MESSAGE routine with the latest version. 15 December 2002. DWF.
;       Fixed a problem in which XSIZE and YSIZE have to be specified as integers to work. 6 March 2006. DWF.
;       Fixed a small problem with very small ROIs that caused the program to crash. 1 October 2008. DWF.
;       Modified the algorithm that determines the number of boundary points for small ROIs. 28 Sept 2010. DWF.
