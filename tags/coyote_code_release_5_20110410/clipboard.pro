; CATEGORY:
;
;      Graphics.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;      CLIPBOARD, window_index
;
; OPTIONAL INPUTS:
;
;       window_index:    The window index number of the graphics window to
;                        copy. If absent, the current graphics window is used
;                        by default.
;
; KEYWORDS:
;
;       All COLOR_QUAN keywords are allowed. In particular, if you are
;       taking snapshots of line plots with few colors in them, you may
;       get better results by calling the program with the CUBE=6 keyword
;       set. Otherwise, white colors can sometimes be a bit gray.
;
; OUTPUTS:
;       None.
;
; COMMON BLOCKS:
;       None.
;
; DEPENDENCIES:
;
;       Uses the IDLgrClipboard object introduced in IDL 5.2(?).
;
; PROCEDURE:
;
;       Copies the window contents to a clipboard object.
;
; EXAMPLE:
;
;        IDL> Window
;        IDL> Plot, Findgen(11)
;        IDL> CLIPBOARD
;
; RESTRICTIONS:
;
;       May not work for all applications. Applications tested successfully
;       include: Framemaker, Powerpoint, Photoshop, Excel, Microsoft Word.
;       Converts 24-bit images to 2D images with color tables.
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;
;       Written by: David W. Fanning, 24 October 2001.
;       Added _EXTRA keyword to pass COLOR_QUAN keywords along. 28 Oct 2002. DWF.
