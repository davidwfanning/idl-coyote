; NAME:
;      iXYOUTS
;
; PURPOSE:
;
;      This program is meant to be an iTools version of the IDL direct graphics
;      program XYOUTS. In other words, it is a way to add strings to a current
;      iTool.

; CATEGORY:
;
;     Graphics
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;     iXYOUTS, theString
;
; ARGUMENTS:
;
;     theString:     The string that will be added to the iTool.
;
; KEYWORDS:       
;
;     Any keyword supported by IDLgrTEXT will be passed along to 
;     the string. Because I want you to see *something* I will
;     tentitively define the following keywords with these
;     default values. You can overwrite any of these defaults
;     by defining your own keywords.
;
;     ALIGNMENT: 0.0             ; Center the string about the location.
;     FONT_SIZE: 12              ; 12-point font.
;     LOCATION: [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]  ; In the center of the unzoomed iTool.
;
;     In addition, you can use the following ID keyword to select the idenifier
;     of a particular iTool. (This is usually obtained from the iTool when it
;     is created: iPlot, findgen(11), IDENTIFIER=id)
;
;     ID:    The identifier of an iTool when the text string is to be displayed.
;            If not used, the current iTool is used.
;
; OUTPUTS:
;
;     None.
;
; EXAMPLE:
;
;     ; First, create an iTool of some kind.
;     IDL> iPlot, findgen(11)
;
;     ; Add a string.
;     IDL> iXYOUTS, 'This is a string'
;
;     ; Add a left-justified red string in 24-point type.
;     IDL> iXYOUTS, 'This is red string', ALIGNMENT=0, COLOR=[255,0,0], FONT_SIZE=24, LOCATION=[-1.25, -0.75, 1.0]
;
; RESTRICTIONS:
;
;     The default view when a iTool starts up and there has been no magification
;     or other manipulation appears to go from -1.4 to 1.4 in X units, from -1.0 to 1.0
;     units in Y, and from 1.0 to -1.0 units in Z. I put the default position in the
;     very center of this viewplane rectangle, at [0,0,1.0], but there is no guarantee you 
;     will actually see the string with this or any other position you use. We are working with 
;     object graphics objects, after all! The text can be selected and moved to position it more
;     exactly. Also, the text is being put into the view in an ONGLASS mode, unless you change
;     this with keywords.
;
; DEPENDENCIES:
;
;     Requires ERROR_MESSAGE from the Coyote Library:
;
;         http://www.dfanning.com/programs/error_message.pro
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;
;      Written by: David W. Fanning, 31 August 2007, from suggestions made
;         by Mike Galloy and Ken Bowman on the IDL newsgroup.
