; :Description:
;   Provides a device-independent way to set the color decomposition state of the
;   current graphics device. Devices that do not have a DECOMPOSED keyword to the
;   DEVICE command are assumed to be in indexed color mode always.
;
; :Categories:
;    Graphics, Utilities
;    
; :Params:
;    state: in, required, type=integer, default=0
;         Set to 1 to set the current graphics device to decomposed color. Set to 0 
;         to set the current graphics device to indexed color. Devices lacking a 
;         DECOMPOSED keyword are assumed to be perpetually in indexed color mode.
;       
; :Keywords:
;     currentstate: out, optional, type=integer
;         The current decomposition state of the current graphics device when the
;         program is called. A 1 indicates decomposed color. A 0 indicates indexed 
;         color.
;     depth: out, optional, type=integer
;         The currnet pixel depth of the graphics device. 
;     zdepth: in, optional, type=integer
;         The pixel depth of the Z-graphics device. Set to 8 or 24. Applies ONLY 
;         when setting the Z-graphics device state to 0. If undefined, the current 
;         depth of the Z-graphics device is unchanged from its current state.
;          
; :Examples:
;       IDL> SetDecomposedState, 0, CurrentState=mode
;       
; : Restrictions:
;       If you set color decomposition on in the Z-graphics buffer, the pixel depth
;       automatically gets set to 24. It does not change back to 8 if color decomposition
;       is turned off.

;        Added DEPTH and ZDEPTH keywords. 31 Dec 2010. DWF.
;        Added a do-nothing NULL device to Case statement. 4 Jan 2011. DWF.
