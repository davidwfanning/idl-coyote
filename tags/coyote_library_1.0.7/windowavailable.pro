;
; PURPOSE:

;       This function returns a 1 if the specified window index number is
;       currently open or available. It returns a 0 if the window is currently
;       closed or unavailable.

; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;       available = WindowAvaiable(windowIndexNumber)
;
; INPUTS:
;
;       windowIndexNumber:   The window index number of the window you wish to
;                            know is available or not.
;
; KEYWORDS:
;
;       None.
;
; NOTES:
;
;       The window vector obtained from the DEVICE command is not always the same length. It
;       is normally (on my machine) 65 elements long, but can be much longer if you have lots
;       of IDL windows open (by calling PickColorName, for example). But if no windows with 
;       index numbers greater than 65 are open, IDL shinks the larger vector to the smaller one
;       as part of its housekeeping operations, which means it happens on their timetable, not yours.
;       This can result in the user having "stale" index numbers greater than 65, but no larger vector
;       to check them against. I have modified the code to return a 0 in this case, assuming that
;       whatever window your index number points to is long gone. I have not experience any ill effects
;       by doing this, but I STRONGLY advice you to ALWAYS know what window you are drawing into
;       when you issue a graphics command.
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;
;       Written by David W. Fanning, June 2005.
;       Modified to return 0 if the window index number is larger than the number of elements
;             in the WINDOW_STATE array. 25 June 2008. DWF.
