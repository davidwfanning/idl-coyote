;   
; :Categories:
;    Utilities
;    
; :Returns:
;     A vector containing the size of each dimension of the image. It is equivalent
;     to calling the SIZE function with the DIMENSIONS keyword set.
;       
; :Params:
;    image:  in, optional, type=various
;        The image variable from which information is to be obtained.
;       
; :Keywords:
;     alphachannel: out, optional, type=boolean
;        This keyword is set to 1 if there is an alpha channel in the image. Otherwise,
;        the keyword is set to 0. 
;     trueindex: out, optional, type=integer
;        The position of the "true color" index in the return value. Is -1 for 2D images.
;     xindex: out, optional, type=integer
;        The index (position) of the X dimension in the return value.
;     xsize: out, optional, type=integer
;        The X size of the image.
;     yindex: out, optional, type=integer
;        The index (position) of the Y dimension in the return value.
;     ysize: out, optional, type=integer
;        The Y size of the image.
;        
; :Examples:
;    To load open a window of the appropriate size and display a 24-bit image::
;
;       dims = Image_Dimensions(image24, XSize=xsize, YSize=ysize, TrueIndex=trueindex)
;       Window, XSIZE=xsize, YSIZE=ysize
