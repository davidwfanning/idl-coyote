; NAME:
;     TVINFO
;
; PURPOSE:
;
;     The purpose of this program is allow interactive inquiry of image
;     position and values for images displayed with either TVIMAGE or TVSCALE.
;     After a call to TVIMAGE or TVSCALE, TVINFO can be called and the user
;     can use the cursor to click in the image display window. If the user clicks
;     inside the image, the image location and value will be printed out in the
;     user's IDL console window.

;
; CATEGORY:
;
;     Graphics display.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;     TVINFO, image
;
; INPUTS:
;
;     image:    A 2D or 3D image array. Values will be returned from this image. (Required)
;
;     position: A four-element array giving image position in the window in normalized
;               coordinates. If not provided, uses the stored position from TVIMAGE or TVSCALE.
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;
;     None.
;
; OUTPUTS:
;
;     Image locations and values are printed in the IDL console window.
;
; SIDE EFFECTS:
;
;     TVINFO blocks the IDL command line until the RIGHT mouse button is clicked
;     in the image display window.
;
; RESTRICTIONS:
;
;     TVINFO *only* works for the last image displayed with TVIMAGE or TVSCALE
;     on a Windows or X device. Precautions are taken to help you avoid shooting
;     yourself in the foot, but I can't anticipate every foolish action at the
;     IDL command line. Expecially if you close the image window before exiting
;     the program with the RIGHT mouse button, you are COMPLETELY on your own!
;
;     Coyote Library programs are required to use TVINFO. Among the ones I know
;     about are these:
;
;      TVIMAGE, TVSCALE, SCALE_VECTOR, IMAGE_DIMENSIONS, ERROR_MESSAGE, CONVERT_TO_TYPE, FPUFIX.
;
;      If the program doesn't compile, you probably need library routines. They
;      can be found here:
;
;           http:/www.dfanning.com/documents/programs.html
;
; EXAMPLE:
;
;     To display an image with axes and then inquire about it:
;
;        filename = FILEPATH(SUBDIR=['examples','data'], 'worldelv.dat')
;        image = BYTARR(360,360)
;        OPENR, lun, filename, /GET_LUN
;        READU, lun, image
;        FREE_LUN, lun
;
;        thisPosition = [0.1, 0.1, 0.9, 0.9]
;        TVIMAGE, image, /KEEP_ASPECT,  POSITION=thisPosition, /AXES
;        TVINFO, image
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;      Written by: David W Fanning, 16 March 2008.
;      Added ability to specify position directly in call. 20 March 2008. DWF
;      Changed cursor operation to conform with expected differences
;         between Windows and UNIX. 20 March 2008, DWF.
;      Slightly modified screen directions. 16 November 2010. DWF.
