; NAME:
;       TextLineFormat
;
; PURPOSE:
;
;       This is a utility program for taking a line of text and shortening
;       it to a defined maximum length. The result of the function is a string
;       array in which no line of text in the string array is longer than the maximum
;       length. The text is broken into "words" by white space. The algorithm is
;       modified slightly if there are LF (line feeds) in the text, or if any single
;       word in the text is too large to fit on a line.

;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;       formattedText = TextLineFormat(theText)
;
; INPUTS:
;
;       theText:   The line of text that is to be formatted.
;
; KEYWORDS:
;
;       LENGTH:    The maximum line length allowed in the resulting text array.
;                  Set to 60 characters by default. Lines greater than length
;                  can be permitted if Line Feeds (ASCII 10B) are found
;                  in the text or single words are too large to fit on a line.
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;
;       Written by David Fanning, June 2005.
;       Fixed a small problem with cumulative total not counting spaces between
;          words. Changed the default size to 60. DWF. 18 August 2005.
;       Added check for LF in text to accommodate reading netCDF file attributes. 
;           If LF are present, I break on these, and return. 15 Feb 2008. DWF.
;       Better handling of lines with no white space in them for breaking. 23 March 2009. DWF.
