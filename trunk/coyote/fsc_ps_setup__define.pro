; NAME:
;   FSC_PS_SETUP__DEFINE
;
; PURPOSE:
;
;    The purpose of FSC_PS_SETUP__DEFINE is to define a structure that is
;    use with cgPS_Open and cgPS_Close, programs that make it easy to set-up
;    for and close a PostScript file. The programs work in close conjunction
;    with cgPS_Config, another program from the Coyote Library.

; CATEGORY:
;
;       Graphics, File Output, PostScript
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;       Used internally in cgPS_Open and cgPS_Close.
;
; COMMON BLOCKS:
;
;       _$FSC_PS_START_   Contains the PS_STRUCT structure for communication between
;                         cgPS_Open and cgPS_Close.
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;
;       Separated from cgPS_Open file, 7 April 2009, by David W. Fanning.
;       Added PAGETYPE field to structure. 8 August 2009. DWF.
;       Changes to handle inability to create raster files from PS encapsulated files in 
;           landscape mode. Added "encapsulated" field to structure. 26 Aug 2011. DWF.
;       Modified to keep track of the "input" True-Type font for PostScript devices. 22 May 2013. DWF.
