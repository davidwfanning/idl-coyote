;   Allows the user to select the cgWindow application to be the "current" application.
;   Selection can be made based on window index number, widget identifier, object reference,
;   or window title.
;
; :Categories:
;    Graphics
;    
; :Params:
;    selection: in, optional, type=varies
;       Normally, a window index number of an cgWindow application. But, the selection
;       can be a widget identifier, an object reference, or a window title, depending on
;       which keywords are set. The cgWindow matching the selection is made the "current"
;       cgWindow and the application is moved forward on the display.
;       
; :Keywords:
;     display: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;         If this keyword is set, the selection is made the "current" application,
;         and then the graphics window of the application is made the current graphics
;         window. If there is no selection, then the current cgWindow graphics window
;         is made the current graphics window.
;     object: in, optional, type=boolean
;         If this keyword is set, the selection is assumed to be an object reference.
;     title: in, optional, type=boolean
;         If this keyword is set, the selection is assumed to be a window title. All
;         matching is done in uppercase characters.
;     widgetid: in, optional, type=boolean
;         If this keyword is set, the selection is assumed to be a widget identifier.
;          
; :Examples:
;    Used with query routine::
;       IDL> wids = cgQuery(TITLE=titles, COUNT=count)
;       IDL> index = Where(StrUpCase(titles) EQ 'PLOT WINDOW', tcnt)
;       IDL> IF tcnt GT 0 THEN cgSet, wids[index]
;       IDL> cgWindow, 'Oplot', thisData, /AddCmd
;       IDL> cgSet ; Bring current window forwad on display
