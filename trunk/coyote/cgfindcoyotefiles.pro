; This procedure looks for Coyote Library routines in every directory in the IDL path
; and reports the directories that it strongly suspects contain Coyote Library files.
; The purpose of this is to aid in eliminating old and out-dated Coyote Library routines
; from your IDL path. The goal is to have a single Coyote Library directory with the latest
; Coyote Library programs in it.
