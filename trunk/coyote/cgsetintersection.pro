; This function is used to find the intersection between two sets of integers.
;
; :Categories:
;    Utilities
;    
; :Returns:
;    A vector of values that are found in both set_a and set_b.
;
; :Params:
;    set_a: in, required, type=integer
;       A vector of integers.
;    set_b: in, required, type=integer
;       A vector of integers.
;
; :Keywords:
;    count: out, optional, type=integer
;         This keyword contains the number of elements in the intersection vector.
;    indices_a: out, optional, type=integer
;         The indices in vector A where the intersected values appear. Note, this requires
;         the intersected points be unique in each vector. The `Positions` keyword will 
;         return ALL the positions of the match, even if there are non-unique matches.
;    indices_b: out, optional, type=integer
;         The indices in vector B where the intersected values appear. This assumes that
;         the intersected points are represented uniquely in the A and B vectors.
;    noresult: in, optional
;         Set this keyword to a value that will be returned from the function
;         if no intersection between the two sets of numbers is found. By default, -1.
;    positions: out, optional, type=integer
;         This keyword returns the positions or locations in A where the values
;         in B appear.
;    success: out, optional, type=boolean
;         This keyword is set to 1 if an intersection was found, and to 0 otherwise.
;
; :Examples:
;    Here is how to use this program::
;      IDL> set_a = [1,2,3,4,5]
;      IDL> set_b = [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]
;      IDL> Print, cgSetIntersection(set_a, set_b)
;           4   5
;
;  See http://www.idlcoyote.com/tips/set_operations.html for other types of set operations.

; :History:
;     Change History::
;        Written by: David W. Fanning, October 31, 2009, from code originally supplied to the IDL
;           newsgroup by Research Systems software engineers.
;        Yikes, bug in original code only allowed positive integers. Fixed now. 2 Nov 2009. DWF.
;        Fixed a problem when one or both of the sets was a scalar value. 18 Nov 2009. DWF.
;        Added a POSITIONS keyword. 30 Nov 2012. DWF.
;        Added a COUNT keyword 3 Dec 2012. DWF.
;        Added INDICES_A and INDICES_B keywords at R.G. Stockwell's suggestion. 13 Dec 2012. DWF.
