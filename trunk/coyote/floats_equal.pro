; NAME:
;       FLOATS_EQUAL
;
; PURPOSE:
;
;       The purpose of this function is to compare two floating-point values or
;       arrays to determine if the values or arrays are equal. Arrays are equal
;       if they have the same number of elements, and each element is equal.
;       
;       To learn why determing if floats are equal is hard (and probably not done
;       correctly in this program), please read the following article::

;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;       result = FLOATS_EQUAL(array_1, array_2)
;
; ARGUMENTS:
;
;       array_1        Any single or double precision value or array. Required parameter.
;
;       array_2        Any single or double precision value or array. Required parameter.
;
; KEYWORDS:
;
;       ULP            UNIT in the LAST PLACE. It is the gap or difference between two
;                      floating point numbers in the last digit that can distinguish the
;                      two numbers. Must be a positive integer. Set to 1 by default. Set
;                      to a larger value if you suspect accumulative round-off errors
;                      in your arrays.
;
; RETURN VALUE:
;
;       result         Set to 1 if the arrays are equal, which means that the arrays have
;                      the same number of elements and each element is equal to the same
;                      element in the other array. Set to 0 if the arrays are not equal.
; COMMON BLOCKS:
;       None.
;
; EXAMPLE:
;
;       IDL> a = Findgen(11)
;       IDL> b = Findgen(11)
;       IDL> Print, Floats_Equal(a,b)
;             1
;       IDL> b[4] = b[4] + 0.0001
;       IDL> Print, Floats_Equal(a,b)
;             0
;
; RESTRICTIONS:
;
;       None.
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;
;       Written by:  David W. Fanning, 29 August 2007.
;       Fixed a problem when using large numbers with the TOTAL command
;          by setting the INTEGER keyword. 22 June 2011. DWF.
;       Made sure ULP value is an integer.
