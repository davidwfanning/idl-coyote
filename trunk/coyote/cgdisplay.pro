;   cgDisplay
;
; PURPOSE:
;   The purpose of cgDisplay is to open a graphics window on the display, or in the
;   PostScript device, or in the Z-graphics buffer, depending upon the current graphics
;   device. In PostScript a window of the proper aspect ratio is created with PSWindow.
;   Using cgDisplay to open "windows" will allow you to more easily write device-independent
;   IDL programs.

;   The purpose of cgDisplay is to open a graphics window on the display, or in the
;   PostScript device, or in the Z-graphics buffer, depending upon the current graphics
;   device. In PostScript a window of the proper aspect ratio is created with cgPSWindow.
;   Using cgDisplay to open "windows" will allow you to more easily write device-independent
;   IDL programs.
;
; :Categories:
;    Graphics
;    
; :Params:
;    pxsize: in, optional, type=integer, default=640
;         The X size of the graphics window created. By default, 640.
;    pysize: in, optional, type=integer, default=512
;         The Y size of the graphics window created. By default, 512.
;         
; :Keywords:
;    aspect, in, optional, type=float
;        Set this keyword to create a window with this aspect ratio (ysize/xsize).
;        If aspect is greater than 1, then the ysize will be used in the aspect
;        ratio calculation. If the aspect is less than or equal to 1, then the
;        xsize will be used in the aspect ratio calculation of the final window size.
;        If the input to the ASPECT keyword is an image, then the aspect ratio will
;        be calculated from the image itself.
;    color: in, optional, type=string/integer, default='white'
;        If this keyword is a string, the name of the data color. By default, 'white'.
;        Color names are those used with cgColor. Otherwise, the keyword is assumed 
;        to be a color index into the current color table. The color is not used if
;        the "window" is opened in PostScript on the Z-graphics buffer.
;    force: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;         Because of the way cgDisplay is designed to work in many devices and in resizeable
;         graphics windows, it is sometimes the case that it won't create a window for you.
;         If you set this keyword, a graphics window will be created while in any device that 
;         supports graphics windows.
;    free: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;         Set this keyword to open a window with a free or unused window index number.
;         This keyword applied only to graphics windows created on the computer display.
;    location: in, optional, type=integer
;         Set this keyword to a two-element integer array indicated the pixel position of
;         the upper-left corner of the graphics window from the upper-left corner of the display.
;    match: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;         If this keyword is set, the new display window will match the size of the current
;         display window, if there is one.
;    pixmap: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;         Set this keyword to create a pixmap window (a window in memory only).
;    retain: in, optional, type=integer
;         Set this keyword to the values 0, 1, or 2, to indicate no backing store, server
;         provided backing store, or IDL provided backing store, respectively. By default,
;         set to 1 for Windows users and to 2 for UNIX users.
;    title: in, optional, type=string
;         Set this keyword to a string that is used as the window title.
;    wid: in, optional, type=integer, default=0
;         The window index number of the IDL graphics window to create.
;    window: in, optional, type=integer, default=0
;         Because I want to use cgDisplay everywhere, including in resizeable graphics
;         windows, and I don't want it opening windows then, it first checks to be sure
;         there are no resizeable graphics windows on the display before it creates a window.
;         Setting this keyword will overrule this check and create a normal IDL graphics window
;         on the display. This will allow you to open a normal graphics window at the same
;         time a resizeable graphics window exists on the display.
;    xpos: in, optional, type=integer
;         The X position of the window, specified in device coordinates. On Motif platforms, 
;         XPOS specifies the X position of the lower left corner and is measured from the 
;         lower left corner of the screen. On Windows platforms, XPOS specifies the X position 
;         of the upper left corner and is measured from the upper left corner of the screen.
;         This value can also be specified as the first element in the `Location` keyword.
;    xsize: in, optional, type=integer, default=640
;         The X size of the graphics window created. By default, 640. The PXSIZE parameter 
;         is used in preference to the XSIZE keyword value.
;    ypos: in, optional, type=integer
;         The Y position of the window, specified in device coordinates. On Motif platforms, 
;         YPOS specifies the Y position of the lower left corner and is measured from the 
;         lower left corner of the screen. On Windows platforms, YPOS specifies the Y position 
;         of the upper left corner and is measured from the upper left corner of the screen.
;         This value can also be specified as the second element in the `Location` keyword.
;    ysize: in, optional, type=integer, default=512
;         The Y size of the graphics window created. By default, 512. The PYSIZE parameter 
;         is used in preference to the YSIZE keyword value.
;    _extra: in, optional, type=any
;         Any keywords supported by the WINDOW command are allowed.
;         
; :Examples:
;    Use like the IDL WINDOW command::
;       IDL> cgDisplay, XSIZE=500 YSIZE=400
;       IDL> cgDisplay, 500, 500, WID=1, COLOR='gray'

; :History:
;     Change History::
;        Written, 15 November 2010. DWF.
;        Changes so that color variables don't change type. 23 Nov 2010. DWF.
;        Moved the window index argument to the WID keyword. 9 Dec 2010. DWF.
;        Modified to produce a window in PostScript and the Z-buffer, too. 15 Dec 2010. DWF.
;        Added the FREE keyword. 3 January 2011. DWF.
;        I made a change that allows you to call cgDisplay inside a program that is
;           going to be added to a cgWindow. The program will not open a graphics window
;           if the current graphics window ID is found in a list of cgWindow window IDs.
;           It is now possible to use cgDisplay in any graphics program, even those that
;           will be run in cgWindow. 17 Nov 2011. DWF.
;        Added ASPECT keyword. 18 Nov 2011. DWF.
;        Allowed the window ASPECT to be set with an image argument. 25 Nov 2011. DWF.
;        Now use Scope_Level to always create a display when cgDisplay is called from
;           the main IDL level. 7 Feb 2012. DWF.
;        Added FORCE and MATCH keywords. 16 Feb 2012. DWF.
;        Added PIXMAP, RETAIN, TITLE, XPOS, YPOS, and LOCATION keywords. 4 Sept 2012. DWF.
;        If only one input parameter is passed, treat that as window index number to create. 15 Feb 2014. DWF.
;        More work to fix a problem with an interaction between cgPS_Open and cgDisplay, when the
;           PostScript file is set up in ENCAPSULATED mode and the ASPECT keyword is used. 8 May 2014. DWF.
