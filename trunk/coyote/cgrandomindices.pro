; This function returns random indices without replacement. You can, for example,
; select 100 random, unique indices from a vector of 10000 random indices.
; 
; The program uses an `algorithm offered by JD Smith <http://www.idlcoyote.com/code_tips/randomindex.html>`
; on the IDL newsgroup.
; 
; :Categories:
;    Utilities
;    
; :Params:
;     length: in, required, type=long
;        The number of random values to be considered in the selection process. In
;        other words, the length of the selection vector.
;     number: in, required, type=long
;        The number of unique, random indices you want the function to return out of
;        the selection vector.
;  
; :Keywords:
;      seed: in, optional, type=long
;         The seed for the random number generator, RandomU. This is also an output
;         variable, which you should use as the input to the next cgRandomIndices call,
;         if you need to do several random selections very quickly in a program.
;         
; :Examples:
;    To select 10 random indices from a list of 100::
;       indices = cgRandomIndices(100, 10, SEED=seed)
;       Print, indices
