; NAME:
;   cgReverseIndices
;
; PURPOSE:
;   Provides a simple way to obtain the data indices from a Histogram REVERSE_INDICES
;   vector. Returns a -1 if no indices are available. Check the COUNT keyword for the
;   number of indices returned.

; :Description:
;   Provides a simple way to obtain the data indices from a Histogram REVERSE_INDICES
;   vector. Returns a -1 if no indices are available. Check the COUNT keyword for the
;   number of indices returned.
;
; :Categories:
;    Utilities
;    
; :Params:
;    ri: in, required, type=integer
;         The REVERSE_INDICES vector that is returned from the HISTOGRAM command.
;    index: in, required, type=integer
;         The zero-based index into the REVERSE_INDICES vector from which to obtain
;         the indices. For example, an index value of 4 will return the indices in
;         the 5th bin (zero based counting) of the histogram. 
;       
; :Keywords:
;     count: out, optional, type=Long
;         The number of indices returned by the function.
;         
; :Return Value:
;      indices:
;         The indices that were put into the indexth bin of the histogram. A -1
;         is returned if no indices are in that particular bin.
;          
; :Examples:
;    Used with the HISTOGRAM command::
;       IDL> image = cgDemoData(7)
;       IDL> h = Histogram(image, REVERSE_INDICES=ri)
;       IDL> indices = cgReverseIndices(ri, 4, COUNT=cnt)
;       IDL> Help, indices, cnt, h[4]
;       INDICES         LONG      = Array[948]
;       CNT             LONG      =          948
;       <Expression>    LONG      =          948
;       IDL> image[indices] = 0
