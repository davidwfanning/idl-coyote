; Converts a PostScript file to a PDF file. This program requires
; the `Ghostscript <http://www.ghostscript.com/download/>` program 
; to be installed on the user's computer, unless you are using a 
; Macintosh computer or an alterntive UNIX command to do the conversion
; for you. If you are on a Macintosh, the supplied pstopdf
; program is used instead. Use the `UNIX_Convert_Cmd` keyword to select
; an alternative UNIX command (e.g., pstopdf or epstopdf).
; 
; The program requires the `Coyote Library <http://www.idlcoyote.com/documents/programs.php>`
; to be installed on your machine.
;
; :Categories:
;    Utilities, Graphics
;    
; :Params:
;     ps_file: in, required, type=string
;         The name of the input PostScript file that is being converted to a PDF file.
;         If not provided, the user will be asked to select a file.
;     pdf_file: in, optional, type=string
;         The name of the output PDF file. If not provided, the name is constructed from
;         the input PostScript file name.
;
; :Keywords:
;     delete_ps: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;         If this keyword is set, the PostScript file will be deleted after conversion.
;     gs_path: in, optional, type=string
;         This program assumes that UNIX users can access Ghostscript with the "gs"
;         command. It assumes WINDOWS users have installed Ghostscript in either
;         the C:\gs or C:\Program Files\gs directories. If either of these assumptions
;         is incorrect, you can specify the directory where the Ghostscript executable
;         resides with this keyword. (The Windows 32-bit executable is named gswin32c.exe
;         and the 64-bit executable is named gswin64c.exe.)
;     pagetype: in, optional, type=string, default="LETTER"
;         Set this keyword to the "type" of page. Possible values are::
;
;            "Letter" - 8.5 by 11 inches.
;            "Legal" - 8.5 by 14 inches.
;            "Ledger" - 11 by 17 inches.
;            "A4" - 21.0 by 29.7 centimeters.
;            
;     showcmd: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;          Set this keyword to print the command that is spawned in the command output window.
;     silent: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;          Set this keyword to suppress output messages.
;     success: out, optional, type=boolean
;          Set this keyword to a named variable that on output will contain a 1 to 
;          indicate successful completion of the command, or to 0 otherwise.
;     unix_convert_cmd: in, optional, type=string
;          There are a number of commands on UNIX machines for converting PostScript files
;          to PDF files. This program assumes you are using Ghostscript to do the conversion
;          for you. The Ghostscript command on most UNIX machines is "gs", which is used if
;          this keyword is undefined. However, if you would prefer to use another program to do
;          the conversion for you, you can specify the name of the command here. For example,
;          "pstopdf" or "epstopdf". In creating the actual command, this command will be
;          separated by a space from the input file name. In other words, if the alternative
;          conversion command was "pstopdf", the actual command would be "pstopdf" + " " + ps_file.
;          Any output filename is ignored. This command does not apply to Macintosh or Windows 
;          computers.
;     version: out, optional, type=string
;         On exit, contains the version of Ghostscipt that was used. Not available on Macs
;         or if an alternative UNIX command was used.
;          
; :Examples:
;    A typical sequence of commands to create a test.pdf file::
;    
;       cgPS_Open, Filename='test.ps'
;       cgHistoplot, cgDemoData(7), /Fill
;       cgPS_Close
;       cgPS2PDF, 'test.ps'

; :History:
;     Change History::
;        Written, 6 December 2011, from code supplied to me by Paul Krummel. DWF.
;        I had been using the Mac command pstopdf to create PDF files on Macs. Unfortunately, these
;           PDF files are rotated incorrectly for plots having a landscape aspect ratio (ie, most plots).
;           In this version of the software, I have decided to have Macs use Ghostscript and ImageMagick
;           like all other UNIX machines. However, I have left the pstopdf code in place to accommodate
;           anyone who prefers that method. You will have to uncomment the appropriate bits of code
;           (there are two places where this has to happen, search for "DARWIN" in the code). 14 Aug 2013. DWF.
