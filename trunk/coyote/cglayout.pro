;+
; The purpose of this program is to return the normalized position coordinates for 
; a line plot, contour plot, or image plot with a specific "layout" in the current
; graphics window. A "layout" has a specified grid of columns and rows organized 
; inside a graphics display window. This is similar to the positions calculated by 
; !P.Multi, although a great deal more flexible. Of course, with additional flexibility 
; and power comes more responsibility. You will be required to use the NoErase keyword
; correctly and you will be responsible for setting the character size on your plots.
; These jobs are normally handled by !P.Multi. Some users will find this liberating, some 
; will find it a pain in the keister. There is always !P.Multi to go back to.
; 
; A grid position is a combination of the number of columns and rows desired, plus
; the application of inside and outside margins, as well as a desired aspect ratio.
; Margins are specified in units of one-third the !D.X_PX_CM value to be device independent. 
; The outside margins locate the grid inside the graphics display window.
; (These are equivalent to !X.OMargin and !Y.OMargin system variable when displaying
; a grid with !P.Multi, for example.) Inside margins use the same units, but are
; used to modify the initial grid positions in the window. (These are equivalent
; to using the XMargin and YMargin keywords on a plot command.) For example, inside margins
; might be used to leave room inside a larger position for color bars or other annotations
; you wish to put on a graphics display. The aspect ratio modifies the grid position
; after the outside and inside margins have been applied to create the final grid position,
; which will be centered in its initial grid position.

;    Graphics, Utilities
;    
; :Returns:
;    This function returns the normalized position coordinates for a particular
;    location in a grid of locations (if the layout parameter is a three-element array),
;    or a 4-by-(ncols*nrows) array of grid positions with one position for each location
;    in the ncols by nrows grid of locations (if the layout parameter is a two-element array).
;    The return variable is suitable for passing to the POSITION keyword of an IDL graphics
;    command (e.g., cgPlot, cgContour, cgImage, etc.). The grid positions are organized in
;    row order, starting with the grid location in the upper-left of the graphihcs display window.
;    
; :Params:
; 
;    layout: in, required, type=integer
;         This parameter sets up the grid layout for the current graphics window. A grid
;         is organized by columns and rows, with the first grid position located in the upper-left
;         corner of the current graphics display window and proceeding in row order. This parameter
;         is either a two-element vector, giving the number of columns and number of rows,
;         respectively (e.g., [ncols,nrows]), or it is a three-element vector, giving, in addition, the
;         specific grid location for which a position is required (e.g, [ncols, nrows, gridPosition]).
;         Grid positions start at 1 with the first grid in the upper left corner of the graphics display 
;         window and proceed in row order, sequentually, until the last grid position, which is equal 
;         to the number of columns times the number of rows.
;       
; :Keywords:
; 
;    aspect: in, optional, type=float
;         This kewyord allows you to specify a specific aspect ratio for the return
;         positions. The aspect ratio is calculated as YDimension/XDimension. So, for
;         example, if you wish the positions to be twice as wide as they are high, you
;         would set the Aspect keyword to 1.0/2.0 or 0.5. If you wish your positions to
;         have a square aspect ratio, you would set the Aspect keyword to 1.0.
;         
;    ixmargin: in, optional, type=integer
;         This keyword is a two-element vector that sets the right and left, respectively, inside
;         X margin for the grid position. Units are multiples of !D.X_CH_SIZE. Default = [0,0].
;         
;    iymargin: in, optional, type=integer
;         This keyword is a two-element vector that sets the bottom and top, respectively, inside
;         Y margin for the grid position. Units are multiples of !D.Y_CH_SIZE. Default = [0,0].
;         
;    oxmargin: in, optional, type=integer
;         This keyword is a two-element vector that sets the right and left, respectively, inside
;         X margin for the grid position. The default OXMargins are suitable for displaying line
;         plots. If you are displaying image plots, you may wish to make the OXMargins the same on
;         both sides of the graphics display window (e.g, OXMargin=[5,5]). Units are multiples of 
;         !D.X_CH_SIZE. Default = [10,4].
;         
;    oymargin: in, optional, type=integer
;         This keyword is a two-element vector that sets the bottom and top, respectively, inside
;         Y margin for the grid position. The default OYMargins are suitable for displaying line
;         plots. There is a little additional room at the top of the plot in the defaults for adding 
;         a title to a multiple plot set-up. Units are multiples of !D.Y_CH_SIZE. Default = [6,8].
;         
;    xgap: in, optional, type=integer, default=14
;         This keywords sets the distance between plots in the X dimension. Units are multiples
;         of !D.X_CH_SIZE.
;         
;    ygap: in, optional, type=integer, default=8
;         This keywords sets the distance between plots in the Y dimension. Units are multiples
;         of !D.Y_CH_SIZE.
;

;       Written, 19 December 2012 by David W. Fanning, from suggestions from Matthew Argall.
;       Changed the notion of one "unit" from the values of !D.X_CH_SIZE and !D.Y_CH_SIZE to
;           1/3 of the value of !D.X_PX_CM. This gives me more consistent measurements on the
