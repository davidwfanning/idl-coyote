; This alpha blends two 24-bit images and displays them with the cgImage command.
; 
; The program requires the `Coyote Library <http://www.idlcoyote.com/documents/programs.php>`
; to be installed on your machine.
;
; :Categories:
;    Graphics
;    
; :Params:
;    foregroundImage: in, required, type=truecolor
;         A 24-bit foreground image with the same dimensions as the background image.
;    backgroundImage: in, required, type=truecolor    
;         A 24-bit background image with the same dimensions as the foreground image.
;
; :Keywords:
;    alpha: in, optional, type=float, default=0.5
;         A number between 0 and 1 that indicates the percentage of the foreground image
;         to alpha-blend into the background image. For example, ALPHA=0.2 will give
;         a weigth of 20% to the foreground image pixels and 80% to the background image
;         pixels. 
;   window: in, optional, type=intarr
;         A one-, two-, or three-element array giving the window index numbers for
;         the foreground, background, and display windows, repectively. If one-element,
;         the foreground image is retrieved from that window and displayed in the current
;         window. If two elements, the foreground and background images are obtained from
;         the first two elements, respectively, and a new third display window is opened.
;         This is the same for three elements, except the third element is used to specify
;         the display window.
;    _ref_extra: in, optional
;         Any keyword appropriate for the cgImage command is also accepted by keyword
;         inheritance.
