; NAME:
;   cgPS_Setup__Define
;
; PURPOSE:
;   The purpose of cgPS_SETUP__DEFINE is to define a structure that is
;   used by cgPS_Open and cgPS_Close to communicate PostScript set-up information
;   back and forth. The idea is to allow simple and error set-up of PostScript and
;   raster file output (though PostScript intermediate files and ImageMagick).

; :History:
;     Change History::
;       Separated from cgPS_Open file, 7 April 2009, by David W. Fanning.
;       Added PAGETYPE field to structure. 8 August 2009. DWF.
;       Changes to handle inability to create raster files from PS encapsulated files in 
;           landscape mode. Added "encapsulated" field to structure. 26 Aug 2011. DWF.
;       Modified to keep track of the "input" True-Type font for PostScript devices. 22 May 2013. DWF.
;       Added RasterFileType field to keep track of what kind of output file should be created
;           from the intermediate PostScript file. 29 Nov 2013. DWF.
;       Created from retired Coyote Library program FSC_PS_SETUP and added rasterFileType field. 29 Nov 2013. DWF.
