; This program calculates user-specified percentiles of a data set.
; A percentile is the value of a variable below which a certain percent 
; of observations fall. In other words, 75% of the values in a data set 
; fall below the 75th percentile of the data. Computing percentiles is 
; really nothing more than counting in a sorted input array. A box-and-whisker
; plot usually will display the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles.
; 
; A `commercial version <http://www.idlcoyote.com/coyotestore/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=2&products_id=196>`
; of this program, containing a DIMENSION keyword, can be purchased from the Coyote Store. The 
; DIMENSION keyword allows the user to calculate the percentiles over a particular dimension
; of a multi-dimensional data set.
;
; :Categories:
;    Math
;    
; :Returns:
;    The return value is either a scalar or vector of data values corresponding to 
;    the number of percentiles asked for with the `Percentiles` keyword, or a -1 if
;    there is an error in the program.
;    
; :Params:
;    data: in, required
;         The data from which percentiles are desired. A vector or an array.
;       
; :Keywords:
;    percentiles: in, optional, type=float
;         Set this keyword to a scalar or vector of values between 0.0 and 1.0 
;         to indicate the percentile desired. A value of 0.5 indicates the 50th
;         percentile. Default value is [0.25, 0.50, 0.75].
;         
; :Examples:
;    To return percentile values for 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 of a data set::
;       IDL> data = Randomu(3L, 100) * 100
;       IDL> Print, cgPercentiles(data, Percentiles=[0.25, 0.5, 0.75])
