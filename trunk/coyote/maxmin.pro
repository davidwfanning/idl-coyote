; :Description:
;    Prints the maximum and minimum of an IDL variable.
; 
; :Categories:
;    Utility
;
; :Params:
;    variable: in, required, type=any
;       The variable whose minimum and maximum you wish to know.
;       
; :Keywords:
;     NAN: in, optional, type=boolean
;       Set this keyword to ignore NANs in the variable. Default: 0.
;     TEXT: in, optional, type=string
;       Prepend this string to the output of MinMax. Default: "MinMax: ".
;       
; :Examples:
;   The MaxMin routine gives the range of the variable::
;     IDL> a = Findgen(11)
;     IDL> MaxMin, a, TEXT='Variable A:'
;     Variable A:   11    0
