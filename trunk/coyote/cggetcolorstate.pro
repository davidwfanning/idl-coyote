;  Provides a device-independent way to get the color decomposition state of the

;
; :Categories:
;    Graphics, Utilities
;    
; :Returns:
;     Returns a 1 if color decomposition is turned on and a 0 if indexed color is used.
;     
; :Params:
;     device: in, optional, type=string
;         The IDL graphics device whose color decomposition state you wish to know the
;         current value of. If undefined, the current graphics device is used.
;       
; :Keywords:
;     Depth: out, optional, type=integer
;         The depth of the color display. Typically 8 for indexed color devices
;         and 24 for true-color devices.
