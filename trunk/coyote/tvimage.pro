; NAME:
;     TVIMAGE
;
; PURPOSE:
;     This purpose of TVIMAGE is to enable the TV command in IDL
;     to be a completely device-independent and color-decomposition-
;     state independent command. On 24-bit displays color decomposition
;     is always turned off for 8-bit images and on for 24-bit images.
;     The color decomposition state is restored for those versions of
;     IDL that support it (> 5.2). Moreover, TVIMAGE adds features
;     that TV lacks. For example, images can be positioned in windows
;     using the POSITION keyword like other IDL graphics commands.
;     TVIMAGE also supports the !P.MULTI system variable, unlike the
;     TV command. TVIMAGE was written to work especially well in
;     resizeable graphics windows. Note that if you wish to preserve
;     the aspect ratio of images in resizeable windows, you should set
;     the KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO keyword, described below. TVIMAGE works
;     equally well on the display, in the PostScript device, and in
;     the Printer and Z-Graphics Buffer devices. The TRUE keyword is
;     set automatically to the correct value for 24-bit images, so you
;     don't need to specify it when using TVIMAGE.

; CATEGORY:
;     Graphics display.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;     TVIMAGE, image
;
; INPUTS:
;     image:    A 2D or 3D image array. It should be byte data. Can also be
;               a 3D image with an alpha channel (e.g., MxNx4).
;
;       x  :    The X position of the lower-left corner of the image.
;               This parameter is only recognized if the TV keyword is set.
;               If the Y position is not used, X is taken to be the image
;               "position" in the window. See the TV command documenation
;               for details.
;
;       y  :    The Y position of the lower-left corner of the image.
;               This parameter is only recognized if the TV keyword is set.
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;
;     ACOLOR:   Set this keyword to the axis color. If a byte or integer value,
;               it will assume you are using INDEXED color mode. If a long integer
;               is will assume you are using DECOMPOSED color mode. If a string,
;               is will pass the string color name along to FSC_COLOR for processing.
;
;     AXES:     Set this keyword to draw a set of axes around the image.
;
;     AXKEYWORDS:   An IDL structure variable of PLOT keywords as structure fields
;               and keyword values as the values of the fields. Pass directly to the
;               PLOT command that draws the axes for the image. Ignored unless the
;               AXES keyword is set. For example,
;
;               TVImage, image, /AXES, AXKEYWORDS={CHARSIZE:1.5, XTITLE:'Distance (mm)', $
;                    YTITLE:'Signal', TICKLEN:-0.025}, ACOLOR='NAVY'
;
;     BACKGROUND:   This keyword specifies the background color. Note that
;               the keyword ONLY has effect if the ERASE keyword is also
;               set or !P.MULTI is set to multiple plots and TVIMAGE is
;               used to place the *first* plot. Can be a string (e.g., 'ivory'), or
;               a 24-bit value that can be decomposed into a color, or an 8-bit
;               index number into the current color table. ERASE and BACKGROUND
;               should only be used on 24-bit devices that support windows!
;
;     BREWER:   If set, applies only to BACKGROUND AND ACOLOR keywords. Selects
;               brewer colors, rather than standard FSC_COLOR colors as strings.
;
;     ERASE:    If this keyword is set an ERASE command is issued
;               before the image is displayed. ERASE and BACKGROUND 
;               should only be used on 24-bit devices that support windows! 
;               The keyword is ignored on 8-bit devices or devices that do
;               not support windows.
;
;     _EXTRA:   This keyword picks up any TV keywords you wish to use.
;
;     HALF_HALF: If set, will tell CONGRID to extrapolate a *half* row
;               and column on either side, rather than the default of
;               one full row/column at the ends of the array.  If you
;               are interpolating images with few rows, then the
;               output will be more consistent with this technique.
;               This keyword is intended as a replacement for
;               MINUS_ONE, and both keywords probably should not be
;               used in the same call to CONGRID.
;
;     KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO: Normally, the image will be resized to fit the
;               specified position in the window. If you prefer, you can
;               force the image to maintain its aspect ratio in the window
;               (although not its natural size) by setting this keyword.
;               The image width is fitted first. If, after setting the
;               image width, the image height is too big for the window,
;               then the image height is fitted into the window. The
;               appropriate values of the POSITION keyword are honored
;               during this fitting process. Once a fit is made, the
;               POSITION coordiates are re-calculated to center the image
;               in the window. You can recover these new position coordinates
;               as the output from the POSITION keyword.
;
;     MARGIN:   A single value, expressed as a normalized coordinate, that
;               can easily be used to calculate a position in the window.
;               The margin is used to calculate a POSITION that gives
;               the image an equal margin around the edge of the window.
;               The margin must be a number in the range 0.0 to 0.333. This
;               keyword is ignored if the POSITION or OVERPLOT keywords are
;               used. It is also ignored when TVImage is executed in a
;               multi-plot window, EXCEPT if it's value is zero. In this
;               special case, the image will be drawn into its position in
;               the multi-plot window with no margins whatsoever. (The
;               default is to have a slight margin about the image to separate
;               it from other images or graphics.
;
;      MULTIMARGIN: Sometimes, when displaying multiple images with !P.Multi, you
;               want the images to be slightly smaller than the position created
;               by !P.Multi so you can add, for example, a colorbar or an annotation
;               to the image. This keyword can be used to adjust the image position
;               by a small margin. A four-element array, the margins apply to the 
;               [bottom, left, top, right] of the image position. So, to
;               leave room at the top of an image for a color bar, you might
;               type this:
;               
;                  TVImage, image, MultiMargin=[0, 0, 4, 0]
;                  
;               This keyword applies *only* to images displayed with !P.Multi, and if
;               passed a scalar value, will use the same value for all four positions.
;               
;     MINUS_ONE: The value of this keyword is passed along to the CONGRID
;               command. It prevents CONGRID from adding an extra row and
;               column to the resulting array, which can be a problem with
;               small image arrays.
;
;     NOINTERPOLATION: Setting this keyword disables the default bilinear
;               interpolation done to the image when it is resized. Nearest
;               neighbor interpolation is done instead. This is preferred
;               when you do not wish to change the pixel values of the image.
;               This keyword must be set, for example, when you are displaying
;               GIF files that come with their own non-IDL color table vectors.
;
;     NORMAL:   Setting this keyword means image position coordinates x and y
;               are interpreted as being in normalized coordinates. This keyword
;               is only valid if the TV keyword is set.
;
;     OVERPLOT: Setting this keyword causes the POSITION keyword to be ignored
;               and the image is positioned in the location established by the
;               last graphics command. For example:
;
;                    Plot, Findgen(11), Position=[0.1, 0.3, 0.8, 0.95]
;                    TVImage, image, /Overplot
;
;     POSITION: The location of the image in the output window. This is
;               a four-element floating array of normalized coordinates of
;               the type given by !P.POSITION or the POSITION keyword to
;               other IDL graphics commands. The form is [x0, y0, x1, y1].
;               The default is [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]. Note that this keyword is ALSO
;               an output keyword. That is to say, upon return from TVIMAGE
;               this keyword (if passed by reference) contains the actual
;               position in the window where the image was displayed. This
;               may be different from the input values if the KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO
;               keyword is set, or if you are using TVIMAGE with the POSITION
;               keyword when !P.MULTI is set to something other than a single
;               plot. One use for the output values might be to position other
;               graphics (e.g., a colorbar) in relation to the image.
;
;               Note that the POSITION keyword should not, normally, be used
;               when displaying multiple images with !P.MULTI. If it *is* used,
;               its meaning differs slightly from its normal meaning. !P.MULTI
;               is responsible for calculating the position of graphics in the
;               display window. Normally, it would be a mistake to use a POSITION
;               graphics keyword on a graphics command that was being drawn with
;               !P.MULTI. But in this special case, TVIMAGE will use the POSITION
;               coordinates to calculate an image position in the actual position
;               calculated for the image by !P.MULTI. The main purpose of this
;               functionality is to allow the user to display images along with
;               colorbars when using !P.MULTI. See the example below.
;
;    QUIET:      There are situations when you would prefer that TVIMAGE does not
;                advertise itself by filling out the FSC_$TVIMAGE common block. For
;                example, if you are using TVIMAGE to draw a color bar, it would
;                not be necessary. Setting this keyword means that TVIMAGE just
;                goes quietly about it's business without bothering anyone else.
;
;    SCALE:     Set this keyword to byte scale the image before display.
;
;     TV:       Setting this keyword makes the TVIMAGE command work much
;               like the TV command, although better. That is to say, it
;               will still set the correct DECOMPOSED state depending upon
;               the kind of image to be displayed (8-bit or 24-bit). It will
;               also allow the image to be "positioned" in the window by
;               specifying the coordinates of the lower-left corner of the
;               image. The NORMAL keyword is activated when the TV keyword
;               is set, which will indicate that the position coordinates
;               are given in normalized coordinates rather than device
;               coordinates.
;
;               Setting this keyword will ensure that the keywords
;               KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO, MARGIN, MINUS_ONE, MULTI, and POSITION
;               are ignored.
;               
;      XRANGE:  If the AXES keyword is set, this keyword is a two-element vector
;               giving the X axis range. By default, [0, size of image in X].
;
;      YRANGE:  If the AXES keyword is set, this keyword is a two-element vector
;               giving the Y axis range. By default, [0, size of image in Y].
;
; OUTPUTS:
;     None.
;
; SIDE EFFECTS:
;     Unless the KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO keyword is set, the displayed image
;     may not have the same aspect ratio as the input data set.
;
; RESTRICTIONS:
;     If the POSITION keyword and the KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO keyword are
;     used together, there is an excellent chance the POSITION
;     parameters will change. If the POSITION is passed in as a
;     variable, the new positions will be returned in the same variable
;     as an output parameter.
;
;     If a 24-bit image is displayed on an 8-bit display, the
;     24-bit image must be converted to an 8-bit image and the
;     appropriate color table vectors. This is done with the COLOR_QUAN
;     function. The TVIMAGE command will load the color table vectors
;     and set the NOINTERPOLATION keyword if this is done. Note that the
;     resulting color table vectors are normally incompatible with other
;     IDL-supplied color tables. Hence, other graphics windows open at
;     the time the image is display are likely to look strange.
;
;     Other programs from Coyote Library (e.g., FSC_COLOR) may also be
;     required.
;
; EXAMPLE:
;     To display an image with a contour plot on top of it, type:
;
;        filename = FILEPATH(SUBDIR=['examples','data'], 'worldelv.dat')
;        image = BYTARR(360,360)
;        OPENR, lun, filename, /GET_LUN
;        READU, lun, image
;        FREE_LUN, lun
;
;        TVIMAGE, image, POSITION=thisPosition, /KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO
;        CONTOUR, image, POSITION=thisPosition, /NOERASE, XSTYLE=1, $
;            YSTYLE=1, XRANGE=[0,360], YRANGE=[0,360], NLEVELS=10
;
;     To display four images in a window without spacing between them:
;
;     !P.Multi=[0,2,2]
;     TVImage, image, Margin=0
;     TVImage, image, Margin=0
;     TVImage, image, Margin=0
;     TVImage, image, Margin=0
;     !P.Multi = 0
;
;     To display four image in a window with associated color bars:
;
;     !P.Multi=[0,2,2]
;     p = [0.02, 0.3, 0.98, 0.98]
;     LoadCT, 0
;     TVImage, image, Position=p
;     Colorbar, Position=[p[0], p[1]-0.1, p[2], p[1]-0.05]

;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;      Written by:     David Fanning, 20 NOV 1996.
;      Fixed a small bug with the resizing of the image. 17 Feb 1997. DWF.
;      Removed BOTTOM and NCOLORS keywords. This reflects my growing belief
;         that this program should act more like TV and less like a "color
;         aware" application. I leave "color awareness" to the program
;         using TVIMAGE. Added 24-bit image capability. 15 April 1997. DWF.
;      Fixed a small bug that prevented this program from working in the
;          Z-buffer. 17 April 1997. DWF.
;      Fixed a subtle bug that caused me to think I was going crazy!
;          Lession learned: Be sure you know the *current* graphics
;          window! 17 April 1997. DWF.
;      Added support for the PRINTER device. 25 June 1997. DWF.
;      Extensive modifications. 27 Oct 1997. DWF
;          1) Removed PRINTER support, which didn't work as expected.
;          2) Modified Keep_Aspect_Ratio code to work with POSITION keyword.
;          3) Added check for window-able devices (!D.Flags AND 256).
;          4) Modified PostScript color handling.
;      Craig Markwart points out that Congrid adds an extra row and column
;          onto an array. When viewing small images (e.g., 20x20) this can be
;          a problem. Added a Minus_One keyword whose value can be passed
;          along to the Congrid keyword of the same name. 28 Oct 1997. DWF
;      Changed default POSITION to fill entire window. 30 July 1998. DWF.
;      Made sure color decomposition is OFF for 2D images. 6 Aug 1998. DWF.
;      Added limited PRINTER portrait mode support. The correct aspect ratio
;          of the image is always maintained when outputting to the
;          PRINTER device and POSITION coordinates are ignored. 6 Aug 1998. DWF
;      Removed 6 August 98 fixes (Device, Decomposed=0) after realizing that
;          they interfere with operation in the Z-graphics buffer. 9 Oct 1998. DWF
;      Added a MARGIN keyword. 18 Oct 1998. DWF.
;      Re-established Device, Decomposed=0 keyword for devices that
;         support it. 18 Oct 1998. DWF.
;      Added support for the !P.Multi system variable. 3 March 99. DWF
;      Added DEVICE, DECOMPOSED=1 command for all 24-bit images. 2 April 99. DWF.
;      Added ability to preserve DECOMPOSED state for IDL 5.2 and higher. 4 April 99. DWF.
;      Added TV keyword to allow TVIMAGE to work like the TV command. 11 May 99. DWF.
;      Added the OVERPLOT keyword to allow plotting on POSITION coordinates
;         estabished by the preceding graphics command. 11 Oct 99. DWF.
;      Added automatic recognition of !P.Multi. Setting MULTI keyword is no
;         longer required. 18 Nov 99. DWF.
;      Added NOINTERPOLATION keyword so that nearest neighbor interpolation
;         is performed rather than bilinear. 3 Dec 99. DWF
;      Changed ON_ERROR condition from 1 to 2. 19 Dec 99. DWF.
;      Added Craig Markwardt's CMCongrid program and removed RSI's. 24 Feb 2000. DWF.
;      Added HALF_HALF keyword to support CMCONGRID. 24 Feb 2000. DWF.
;      Fixed a small problem with image start position by adding ROUND function. 19 March 2000. DWF.
;      Updated the PRINTER device code to take advantage of available keywords. 2 April 2000. DWF.
;      Reorganized the code to handle 24-bit images on 8-bit displays better. 2 April 2000. DWF.
;      Added BACKGROUND keyword. 20 April 2000. DWF.
;      Fixed a small problem in where the ERASE was occuring. 6 May 2000. DWF.
;      Rearranged the PLOT part of code to occur before decomposition state
;         is changed to fix Background color bug in multiple plots. 23 Sept 2000. DWF.
;      Removed MULTI keyword, which is no longer needed. 23 Sept 2000. DWF.
;      Fixed a small problem with handling images that are slices from 3D image cubes. 5 Oct 2000. DWF.
;      Added fix for brain-dead Macs from Ben Tupper that restores Macs ability to
;         display images. 8 June 2001. DWF.
;      Fixed small problem with multiple plots and map projections. 29 June 2003. DWF.
;      Converted all array subscripts to square brackets. 29 June 2003. DWF.
;      Removed obsolete STR_SEP and replaced with STRSPLIT. 27 Oct 2004. DWF.
;      Small modification at suggestion of Karsten Rodenacker to increase size of
;         images in !P.MULTI mode. 8 December 2004. DWF.
;      Minor modifications on Karsten Rodenacker's own account concerning margination
;         and TV behaviour. 8 December 2004. KaRo
;      There was a small inconsistency in how the image was resized for PostScript as
;         opposed to the display, which could occasionally result in a small black line
;         to the right of the image. This is now handled consistently. 3 January 2007. DWF.
;      Made a small change to CMCONGRID to permit nearest-neighbor interpolation for 3D arrays.
;         Previously, any 24-bit image was interpolated, no matter the setting of the NOINTERP
;         keyword. 22 April 2007. DWF.
;      Updated the program for the 24-bit Z-buffer in IDL 6.4. 11 June 2007. DWF.
;      Added new POSITION keyword functionality for !P.MULTI display. 9 Sept 2007. DWF.
;      Bit one too many times. Added _STRICT_EXTRA keywords for all _EXTRA keywords. 1 Feb 2008. DWF.
;      Added FSC_$TVIMAGE common block for interactive interaction with TVINFO. 16 March 2008. DWF.
;      Added SCALE keyword. 18 March 2008. DWF.
;      Added keywords to allow axes to be drawn around the image. 18 March 2008. DWF.
;      Added QUIET keyword to allow by-passing of FSC_$TVIMAGE common block updating. 21 March 2008. DWF.
;      Made BACKGROUND and ERASE valid keywords only on 24-bit devices. Ignored on others. 28 May 2008. DWF.
;      Cannot make color work in device independent way for axes, unless I handle axis color directly. To this

; NAME:
;  TVIMAGE_CONGRID
;
; PURPOSE:
;       Shrink or expand the size of an array by an arbitrary amount.
;       This IDL procedure simulates the action of the VAX/VMS
;       CONGRID/CONGRIDI function.
;
;  This function is similar to "REBIN" in that it can resize a
;       one, two, or three dimensional array.   "REBIN", however,
;       requires that the new array size must be an integer multiple
;       of the original size.   CONGRID will resize an array to any
;       arbitrary size (REBIN is somewhat faster, however).
;       REBIN averages multiple points when shrinking an array,
;       while CONGRID just resamples the array.
;
; CATEGORY:
;       Array Manipulation.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;  array = TVIMAGE_CONGRID(array, x, y, z)
;
; INPUTS:
;       array:  A 1, 2, or 3 dimensional array to resize.
;               Data Type : Any type except string or structure.
;
;       x:      The new X dimension of the resized array.
;               Data Type : Int or Long (greater than or equal to 2).
;
; OPTIONAL INPUTS:
;       y:      The new Y dimension of the resized array.   If the original
;               array has only 1 dimension then y is ignored.   If the
;               original array has 2 or 3 dimensions then y MUST be present.
;
;       z:      The new Z dimension of the resized array.   If the original
;               array has only 1 or 2 dimensions then z is ignored.   If the
;               original array has 3 dimensions then z MUST be present.
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;       INTERP: If set, causes linear interpolation to be used.
;               Otherwise, the nearest-neighbor method is used.
;
;       CUBIC:  If set, uses "Cubic convolution" interpolation.  A more
;               accurate, but more time-consuming, form of interpolation.
;               CUBIC has no effect when used with 3 dimensional arrays.
;
;       MINUS_ONE:
;               If set, will prevent CONGRID from extrapolating one row or
;               column beyond the bounds of the input array.   For example,
;               If the input array has the dimensions (i, j) and the
;               output array has the dimensions (x, y), then by
;               default the array is resampled by a factor of (i/x)
;               in the X direction and (j/y) in the Y direction.
;               If MINUS_ONE is present (AND IS NON-ZERO) then the array
;               will be resampled by the factors (i-1)/(x-1) and
;               (j-1)/(y-1).
;
;       HALF_HALF:
;               If set, will tell CONGRID to extrapolate a *half* row
;               and column on either side, rather than the default of
;               one full row/column at the ends of the array.  If you
;               are interpolating images with few rows, then the
;               output will be more consistent with this technique.
;               This keyword is intended as a replacement for
;               MINUS_ONE, and both keywords probably should not be
;               used in the same call to CONGRID.
;
; OUTPUTS:
;  The returned array has the same number of dimensions as the original
;       array and is of the same data type.   The returned array will have
;       the dimensions (x), (x, y), or (x, y, z) depending on how many
;       dimensions the input array had.
;
; PROCEDURE:
;       IF the input array has three dimensions, or if INTERP is set,
;       then the IDL interpolate function is used to interpolate the
;       data values.
;       If the input array has two dimensions, and INTERP is NOT set,
;       then the IDL POLY_2D function is used for nearest neighbor sampling.
;       If the input array has one dimension, and INTERP is NOT set,
;       then nearest neighbor sampling is used.
;
; EXAMPLE:
;       ; vol is a 3-D array with the dimensions (80, 100, 57)
;       ; Resize vol to be a (90, 90, 80) array
;       vol = TVIMAGE_CONGRID(vol, 90, 90, 80)
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;       DMS, Sept. 1988.
;       DMS, Added the MINUS_ONE keyword, Sept. 1992.
;  Daniel Carr. Re-wrote to handle one and three dimensional arrays
;                    using INTERPOLATE function.
;  DMS, RSI, Nov, 1993.  Added CUBIC keyword.
;       Craig Markwardt, Dec, 1997.  Added halfhalf keyword to
;                        more evenly distribute "dead" pixel row
;       Use uniformly spaced grid points for half_half W. Landsman   Feb. 2000
;              (and slightly modified by C. Markwardt 14 Feb 2000)
;  DWF, FSC, 22 Apr 2007. Modified the program so that 3D arrays use nearest-neighbor
;       interpolation unless the INTERP keyword is set.
;  DWF, FSC, 22 Apr 2007. Function renamed from CMCONGRID to TVIMAGE_CONGRID on
;       recommendation of Craig Markwardt as he wants no part of this. :-)
