; NAME:
;   FSC_Resize_Image
;
; PURPOSE:
;   Provides a CONGRID like resizing of images, although it performs this service
;   correctly for both 2D and 3D images. Pixel locations do not change in the output
;   image, since the center of the pixel is used for interpolation purposes, rather than
;   the lower-left corner of the pixel. Unlike CONGRID, 3D images can use nearest neighbor
;   interpolation as well as bilinear interpolation.

; :Description:

; :Categories:
;    Utilities
;    
; :Params:
;    image: in, required, type=any
;         The image variable to resize. Must be a 2D or 3D image. If a 3D image,
;         one of the image dimensions must be a 3.
;         
;    cols: in, required, type=integer
;          The number of columns (i.e., XSIZE) in the output image.
;          
;    rows: in, required, type=integer
;          The number of rows (i.e., YSIZE) in the output image.
;                 
; :Keywords:
;     interpolate: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;         Is set, bilinear interpolation is used to resize the image. Otherwise,
;         nearest neighbor sampling is used instead.
;      minus_one: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;          Identical to CONGRID MINUS_ONE keyword. 
;          
; :Examples:
;    Used in a similar fashion to the Congrid command, but for images::
;       IDL> bigEarth = FSC_Resize_Image(LoadData(7), 720, 720)
;       IDL> bigRose  = FSC_Resize_Image(LoadData(16), 681, 447)

;     I have been convinced (conversations with Wayne Landsman) that if the 
;         CENTER keyword is set, the MINUS_ONE keyword is not needed, since 
;         it was created to solve the same problem. So, I have changed the 
;         default setting of MINUS_ONE to 0. 11 Jan 2011. DWF.
