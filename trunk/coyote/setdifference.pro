; NAME:
;  SETDIFFERENCE
;
; PURPOSE:
;
;   This function is used to find the difference between two sets of integers.
;   In other words, the function will find the values that are in Set A but
;   are missing in Set B.

; CATEGORY:
;
;   Utilities
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;   difference = SetDifference(set_a, set_b)
;
; RETURN VALUE:
;
;   difference:  A vector of values that are found in set_a but are missing in set_b.
;
; ARGUMENTS:
;
;   set_a:         A vector of integers.
;   
;   set_b:         A vector of integers.
;
; KEYWORDRS:
;
;  NORESULT:       Set this keyword to a value that will be returned from the function
;                  if no difference between the two sets of numbers is found. By default, set_a.
;                  
;  SUCCESS:        An output keyword that is set to 1 if a difference was found, and to 0 otherwise.
;   
; EXAMPLE:
;
;  IDL> set_a = [1,2,3,4,5]
;  IDL> set_b = [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]
;  IDL> Print, SetDifference(set_a, set_b)
;          1  2  3 
;
;  See http://www.dfanning.com/tips/set_operations.html for other types of set operations.
;  
; NOTES:
; 
;  If you read the Set Operations article pointed to above, you will see quite a lot of
;  discussion about what kinds of algorithms are faster than others. The Histogram 
;  algorithms implemented here are sometimes NOT the fastest algorithms, especially 
;  for sparse arrays. If this is a concern in your application, please be sure to read
;  that article.

;     newsgroup by Research Systems software engineers.
