;
;+
; The purpose of `cgPS_Open` and cgPS_Close is to make it easy to set-up
; and close a PostScript file. These programs are used extensively
; in all Coyote Graphics routines.
;
; If `ImageMagick  <http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php>` is installed 
; on your computer, you can easily convert PostScript output to GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF
; raster output. If `Ghostscript <http://www.ghostscript.com/download/>` is installed
; you can convert PostScript output to PDF files. See the appropriate keywords below.
; 
; When cgPS_Open is called, the current graphics device is set to "PS" (the PostScript 
; device). When cgPS_Close is called the current graphics device is returned to the device
; in effect when cgPS_Open was called.

; :Categories:
;    Utilities, Graphics
;    
; :Keywords:
;     allow_transparent: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;         To make the background of some image files white, rather than transparent,
;         you have to set the "-alpha off" string in the ImageMagick call. This
;         string is automatically added to the ImageMagick call unless this keyword
;         is set, in which case the string is not added and the image background will
;         be transparent.  
;     bmp: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0                 
;        Set this keyword to convert the PostScript output file to a BMP image. Requires ImageMagick.
;     delete_ps: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0            
;        Setting this keyword will delete the PostScript file that is used as the intermediate
;        file in the conversion to other file types.
;     density: in, optional, type=integer, default=300
;        The horizontal and vertical density (in dots per inch, DPI) of the image when the PostScript file
;        is converted to a raster format by ImageMagick. 
;     filetype: in, optional, type='string', default=""
;        This keyword provides a generic way of setting the `BMP`, `GIF`, `JPEG`, `PNG`, and `TIFF` 
;        keywords. Set this keyword to the type of file output desired, and the correct "output"
;        keyword will be set.
;     gif: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0                 
;        Set this keyword to convert the PostScript output file to a GIF image. Requires ImageMagick.
;     gs_path: in, optional, type=string
;        This program assumes that UNIX users can access Ghostscript with the "gs"
;        command. It assumes WINDOWS users have installed Ghostscript in either
;        the C:\gs or C:\Program Files\gs directories. If either of these assumptions
;        is incorrect, you can specify the directory where the Ghostscript executable
;        resides with this keyword. (The Windows 32-bit executable is named gswin32c.exe
;        and the 64-bit executable is named gswin64c.exe.) Passed directly to cgPS2PDF.
;     height: in, optional, type=integer
;        Set the keyword to the final pixel hight of the output raster image. Applies
;        only to raster image file output (e.g., JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc.). The width of
;        the image is chosen to preserve the image aspect ratio. Cannot use with the `Width` keyword.
;     im_options: in, optional, type=string, default=""
;        A string of ImageMagick "convert" options that can be passed to the ImageMagick convert 
;        command. No error checking occurs with this string.
;     jpeg: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0                 
;        Set this keyword to convert the PostScript output file to a JPEG image. Requires ImageMagick.
;     nofix: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0  
;        If this keyword is set, then the cgFixPS program to fix IDL landscape
;        PostScript files is not called.
;     nomessage: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0                  
;        If this keyword is set, then no error messages are issued. The keyword is used primarily 
;        to allow cgPS_Close to reset the internal structure without a lot of ruckus.  
;     outfilename: out, optional, type=string
;        The name of the output filename created by the program.             
;     pdf: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0                 
;        Set this keyword to convert the PostScript output file to a PDF file. Requires Ghostscript.
;     png: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0                 
;        Set this keyword to convert the PostScript output file to a PNG image. Requires ImageMagick.
;        Normally, 24-bit PNG files are created. However, if the IM_PNG8 keyword is set with
;        cgWindow_SetDefs, then cgPS_Close will create an 8-bit PNG file instead.
;     resize: in, optional, type=integer, default=25
;        If an image is being created from the PostScript file, it is often resized by some 
;        amount. You can use this keyword to change the value (e.g, RESIZE=100).
;        The value is passed on to resize argument as a percentage in the ImageMagick call.
;     showcmd: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;        Set this command to show the command used to do any PostScript coversions.
;     tiff: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0                 
;        Set this keyword to convert the PostScript output file to a TIFF image. Requires ImageMagick.
;     unix_convert_cmd: in, optional, type=string
;         There are a number of commands on UNIX machines for converting PostScript files
;         to PDF files. This program assumes you are using Ghostscript to do the conversion
;         for you. The Ghostscript command on most UNIX machines is "gs", which is used if
;         this keyword is undefined. However, if you would prefer to use another program to do
;         the conversion for you, you can specify the name of the command here. For example,
;         "pstopdf" or "epstopdf". In creating the actual command, this command will be
;         separated by a space from the input file name. In other words, if the alternative
;         conversion command was "pstopdf", the actual command would be "pstopdf" + " " + ps_file.
;         Any output filename is ignored. This command does not apply to Macintosh or Windows 
;         computers. Passed directly to cgPS2PDF.
;     width: in, optional, type=integer
;         Set the keyword to the final pixel width of the output raster image. Applies
;         only to raster image file output (e.g., JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc.). The height of
;         the image is chosen to preserve the image aspect ratio. Cannot use with the `Height` keyword.
;          
; :Examples:
;    To create a line plot in a PostScript file named lineplot.ps and
;    also create a PNG file named lineplot.png for display in a browser,
;    type these commands::
;
;        cgPS_Open, 'lineplot.ps'
;        cgPlot, Findgen(11), COLOR='navy', XTITLE='Time', YTITLE='Signal'
;        cgPS_Close, /PNG
;        
;    If you just want the raster file, without a PostScript file, it is simpler to just specify
;    the type of file you want with cgPS_Open. Here we create a JPEG file. The intermediate
;    PostScript file is deleted once the JPEG file is created::
;    
;        cgPS_Open, 'lineplot.jpg'
;        cgPlot, Findgen(11), COLOR='navy', XTITLE='Time', YTITLE='Signal'
;        cgPS_Close
;
;     An example using the UNIX epstopdf command instead of an ImageMagick command to create a PDF file::
;     
;         cgPS_Open, 'lineplot.eps', /DECOMPOSED
;         cgPlot, Findgen(11), COLOR='navy', XTITLE='Time', YTITLE='Signal'
;         cgPS_Close, /PDF, UNIX_CONVERT_CMD='epstopdf --autorotate=All'

;
; :History:
;     Change History::
;       Written by: David W. Fanning, 20 May 2008.
;       Slight modification to allow filenames with spaces in them.
;       Added NoMatch keyword. 17 March 2009. DWF.
;       Added a number of keywords to make these commands more configurable. 19 March 2009. DWF.
;       Only set thickness system variables if starting system variables are set to their
;           default values (namely, 0). This allows users to set their own system variables
;           before they call PS_START, rather than after. 23 March  2009. DWF.
;       Moved PS_END to its own file to allow the IDLExBr_Assistant to work properly. 7 April 2009. DWF.
;       Reordered ImageMagick commands to put them in the proper sequence to get "alpha" switch to work. 23 April 2009. DWF.
;       Put the switches *ahead* of the PostScript file name. Now resizing works and default size reduction
;           returned to 25%. 23 April 2009. DWF.
;       Still having a devil of a time getting the ImageMagick "convert" command right. Fonts
;           have become a problem. Now trying a "flatten" option in the command. 12 May 2009. DWF.
;       If the PostScript file is in Landscape mode, it is now "fixed" with cgFixPS to allow it
;           to be displayed right-side up in PostScript viewers. 8 August 2009. DWF.
;       Fixed a problem in not checking the GIF keyword properly. 4 December 2009. DWF.
;       Added NOFIX keyword to the program. 1 November 2010. DWF.
;       Added better handing of errors coming from cgFixPS after update to FIXPS. 15 November 2010. DWF.
;       Added DELETE_PS keyword. 16 Jan 2011. DWF.
;       Better protection of code from not finding ImageMagick. 17 Jan 2011. DWF.
;       Collecting result of SPAWN command. Only printing if QUIET=0. 16 Feb 2011. DWF.
;       Changes to handle inability to create raster files from PS encapsulated files in 
;           landscape mode. Added NOMESSAGE keyword. 26 Aug 2011. DWF.
;        Added PDF keyword. Requires Ghostscript to use. 6 Dec 2011. DWF.
;        Added SHOWCMD keyword. 9 Dec 2011. DWF.
;        Added OUTFILENAME keyword. 11 Dec 2011. DWF.
;        Just realized a BMP case is missing from one of the CASE statements. 12 Dec 2011. DWF.
;        Added GS_PATH and UNIX_CONVERT_CMD keywords to support PDF output. 14 Dec 2011. DWF.
;        Add the WIDTH keyword. 3 April 2012. DWF.
;        Added a check for IM_PNG8 keyword, using cgWindow_GetDefs to see if an 8-bit or 24-bit
;           PNG file should be created. 3 April 2012. DWF.
;        Modified the ImageMagick commands that resizes the image to a particular width. Necessary
;           to accommodate PNG8 file output. Using ImageMagick 6.7.2-9. 4 April 2012. DWF.
;        Added FILETYPE keyword to provide a generic way of creating raster file output. 30 August 2012. DWF.
;        Modified to use the cgPS2Raster program so code doesn't have to be maintained in 
;            two places. 15 Oct 2012. DWF.
;        Added a check for ImageMagick and an informational message for raster operations. 4 Nov 2012. DWF.
;        Fixed a problem in which the NOMESSAGE keyword was not getting passed along to cgPS2Raster. 5 Nov 2012. DWF.
;        Fixed a problem where I was not passing the PORTRAIT keyword to cgPS2Raster properly. 22 Jan 2013. DWF.
;        Modified to restore the input True-Type font for PostScript devices. 22 May 2013. DWF.
;        Can now create raster file output directly from the input filename of cgPS_Open. 29 Nov 2013. DWF.
;        The program wasn't picking up default values from cgWindow_GetDefs. 22 Jan 2014. DWF.
;        Added HEIGHT keyword. 20 Feb 2014. DWF.
;        Was not passing the QUIET flag from cgPS_Open on to cgPS2Raster correctly. Fixed. 28 Feb 2014. DWF.
;        Modified to call cgPS2PDF directly for PDF output. Required because UNIX_CONVERT_CMD isn't passed
;           through cgPS2Raster. 6 March 2014. DWF.
