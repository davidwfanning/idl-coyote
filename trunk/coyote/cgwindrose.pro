; This program draws a wind rose diagram. A wind rose diagram shows the frequency, speed, and 
; direction of winds over some defined period of time. It is widely used in meteorological
; applications (`see here: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_rose>`).
; 
; Data to test the program (in SAMPSON formatted data files) can be freely downloaded from
; the `Meteorological Resource Center <http://www.webmet.com/>`.
