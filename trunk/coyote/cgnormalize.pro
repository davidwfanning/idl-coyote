; This is a utility routine to calculate the scaling vector required to position a 
; graphics primitive of specified range at a specific position in an arbitray coordinate 
; system. The scaling vector is given as a two-element array like this::
;
;    scalingVector = [translationFactor, scalingFactor]
;
; The scaling vector should be used with the [XYZ]COORD_CONV keywords of a graphics object 
; or model. For example, if you wanted to scale an X axis into the coordinate range of 
; -0.5 to 0.5, you might type something like this::
;
;    xAxis->GetProperty, Range=xRange
;    xScale = cgNormalize(xRange, Position=[-0.5, 0.5])
;    xAxis, XCoord_Conv=xScale
;
; :Categories:
;    Graphics Utility
;
; :Params:
;    range: in, required
;       A two-element vector specifying the data range.
;
; :Keywords:
;    position: in, optional, type=float
;       A two-element vector specifying the location in the coordinate system you 
;       are scaling into. The vector [0.0,1.0] is used by default if Position is not 
;       specified.
;
; :Examples:
;    Here is how to use this program::
;    
;       xAxis->GetProperty, Range=xRange
;       xScale = cgNormalize(xRange, Position=[-0.5, 0.5])
;       xAxis, XCoord_Conv=xScale

;       Written by:  David W. Fanning, OCT 1997.
;       Fixed a problem with illegal divide by zero. 21 April 2005. DWF.
;       Fixed a problem when range[0] is greater than range[1]. 11 July 2006. DWF.
;       Renamed to FSC_Normalize to avoid conflicts with 10,000 other programs named NORMALIZE. 17 October 2008. DWF.
;       Renamed to cgNormalize 6 February 2013. DWF.
;       The number I chose (1e-12) to fix the illegal divide by zero problem was too large. I'm now using 
;           1d-25 instead. 9 September 2013. DWF.
