; NAME:
;     FINDPRO
; PURPOSE:
;     Find all locations of a procedure in the IDL !PATH
; EXPLANATION:
;     FINDPRO searces for the procedure name (as a .pro or a .sav file) in all 
;     IDL libraries or directories given in the !PATH system variable.    This
;     differs from the intrinsic FILE_WHICH() function which only finds the 
;     first occurence of the procedure name.
;               
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;    FINDPRO, [ Proc_Name, /NoPrint, DirList = , ProList = ]
;
; OPTIONAL INPUT:
;     Proc_Name - Character string giving the name of the IDL procedure or 
;             function. Do not include the ".pro" extension. If Proc_Name is
;             omitted, the program will prompt for PROC_NAME.  "*" wildcards
;             are permitted.
;
; OPTIONAL KEYWORD INPUT:
;     /NoPrint - if set, then the file's path is not printed on the screen and
;             absolutely no error messages are printed on the screen.  If not
;             set, then - since the MESSAGE routine is used - error messages 
;             will be printed but the printing of informational messages
;             depends on the value of the !Quiet variable.
;
; OPTIONAL KEYWORD OUTPUTS:
;     DirList - The directories in which the file is located are returned in
;             the keyword as a string array.
;             If the procedure is an intrinsic IDL procedure, then the 
;             value of DirList = ['INTRINSIC'].
;             If the procedure is not found, the value of DirList = [''].
;     ProList - The list (full pathnames) of procedures found.  Useful if you
;             are looking for the name of a procedure using wildcards.
;
;     The order of the names in DirList and ProList is identical to the order
;     in which the procedure name appears in the !PATH
; PROCEDURE:
;     The system variable !PATH is parsed using EXPAND_PATH into individual 
;     directories.  FILE_SEARCH() is used to search the directories for
;     the procedure name.  If not found in !PATH, then the name is compared 
;     with the list of intrinsic IDL procedures given by the ROUTINE_INFO()
;     function. 
;
; EXAMPLE:
;     (1) Find the procedure CURVEFIT.  Assume for this example that the user
;     also has a copy of the curvefit.pro procedure in her home directory
;     on a Unix machine.
;
;       IDL> findpro, 'curvefit', DIRLIST=DirList
;       Procedure curvefit.pro found in directory  /home/user/.
;       Procedure curvefit.pro found in directory  /home/idl/lib/userlib 
;       IDL> help, DirList
;       DIRLIST         STRING    = Array(2) 
;       IDL> help, DirList[0], DirList[1]
;       <Expression>    STRING    = '/home/user'
;       <Expression>    STRING    = '/home/idl/lib/userlib' 
;
;     (2) Find all procedures in one's !path containing the characters "zoom" 
;
;       IDL> findpro,'*zoom*'
; RESTRICTIONS:
;       User will be unable to find a path for a native IDL function
;       or procedure, or for a FORTRAN or C routine added with CALL_EXTERNAL.
;       Remember that Unix is case sensitive, and most procedures will be in
;       lower case.
;
; PROCEDURES USED:
;       ZPARCHECK, FDECOMP
; REVISION HISTORY:
;       Based on code extracted from the GETPRO procedure, J. Parker 1994
;       Use the intrinsic EXPAND_PATH function    W. Landsman Nov. 1994
;       Use ROUTINE_NAMES() to check for intrinsic procs   W. Landsman Jul 95
;       Added Macintosh, WINDOWS compatibility    W. Landsman   Sep. 95
;       Removed spurious first element in PROLIST  W. Landsman  March 1997
;       Don't include duplicate directories  in !PATH  WL   May 1997
;       Use ROUTINE_INFO instead of undocumented ROUTINE_NAMES W.L. October 1998
;       Also check for save sets   W. Landsman  October 1999 
;       Force lower case check for VMS  W. Landsman January 2000 
;       Only return .pro or .sav files in PROLIST   W. Landsman  January 2002 
;       Force lower case check for .pro and .sav    D. Swain  September 2002 
;       Use FILE_SEARCH() if V5.5 or later   W. Landsman June 2006
;       Assume since V55, remove VMS support W. Landsman Sep. 2006
