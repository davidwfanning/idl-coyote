;+
;   This program simply collects files created from the cgImage2KML program and moves
;   the files to a zip file with a *.kmz file extention. The program requires that the
;   file archiver 7-Zip be installed on the user's computer. The 7-Zip program is freeware
;   and is available for Windows, Mac, and UNIX users. Addtional information about the 7-Zip
;   program can be found on the `7-Zip web page <http://www.7-zip.org/>`. The current program
;   runs on Windows computers only, and with 7-Zip installed in the C:\Program Files directory.
;   You may have to modify the path the the 7z.exe executable file to get the program to work
;   correctly for you. The line to modify is clearly marked below.
;   
;   KMZ files are simply zip files containing KML files and support files. You can create your
;   own KMZ files with any archiving software that supports the ZIP compression format.
;
; :Categories:
;    Utility
;    
; :Params:
;    kml_filename: in, optional, type=string
;         The name of a KML file to package as a KMZ file.
;         
;    supportfiles: in, optional, type=string
;         A scalar or vector of files to be included with the KML file to be packaged.
;         If not present, files in the same directory as the KML file and having the
;         same base filename will be used.
;         
; :Keywords:
;     showcmd: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;         Set this keyword if you wish to see the command being spawned by the program.
;     silent: in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;         Set this kewyord to avoid output (except program errors) from being printed.
;       
; :Examples:
;    Here is how to use this program with the Google Earth Image example in the
;    `Coyote Gallery <http://www.idlcoyote.com/gallery/>`. The result is a file
;    named "google_earth_image.kmz" that can be loaded into Google Earth.
