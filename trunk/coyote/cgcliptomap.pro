; Allows an image or geoTiff file to be clipped or subset to a map projected boundary.
;
; :Categories:
;    Map Utilities
;    
; :Returns:
;    The clipped or subsetted image is returned.
;    
; :Params:
;    imageIn: in, required, type=varies
;        Either a 2D or true-color image (in which, in both cases, a map coordinate object must be provided with the
;        MAP keyword) or the name of the GeoTiff file from which an image and a map coordinate object
;        can be obtained.
;    boundary: in, required, type=fltarr
;        A four-element array containing the map boundary to which the image should be clipped.
;       
; :Keywords:
;     latlonbox: out, optional, type=fltarr
;         A four-element array representing the boundary of the output image in
;         the Google Map preferred form of [north, south, east, west] in decimal
;         degrees.
;     map: in, required, type=object
;         A map coordinate object (cgMap) that maps or georeferences the input image.
;     outboundary: out, optional, type=fltarr
;         A four-element array containing the final map boundary of the clipped image.
;         The boundary will be in XY coordinates (projected meters).
;     outmap: out, optional, type=object
;         An output map coordinate object (cgMap) that describes the output image.
;     outposition: out, optional, type=intarr
;         A four-element array containing the pixel locations of the output image
;         in the input image pixel coordinate system: [x0,y0,x1,y1]. In other words,
;         these are the values used to subset the input image.

; :History:
;     Change History::
;        Written, 16 August 2012. DWF. 
;        If the absolute value of the maximum of the boundary is LE 360, assume you need to convert
;           from lat/lon space to projected meter space. 23 Aug 2012. DWF.
;        Added MAPOUT and LATLONBOX keywords. 1 Nov 2012. DWF.
;        Added OUTPOSITION keywords. 29 Nov 2012. DWF.
;        I have reason to believe the way I was creating the location vectors and
;           and image subset in this program was causing me to be 1 pixel off in
;           creating the image subset. The algorithm has been tweaked to correct this. 12 Dec 2012. DWF.
;        Duh! Changed the name of MapOut keyword to OutMap to make it work, but forgot to change 
;            the variable name. Output map coordinate object now returning properly. 20 May 2014. DWF.
