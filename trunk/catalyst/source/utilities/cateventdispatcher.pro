; NAME:
;       CatEventDispatcher
;
; PURPOSE:
;
;       The purpose of this utility routine is to intercept the event
;       callbacks from widgets and pass the "event" on to an object
;       EventHandler method. The EventHandler method must be written
;       with one positional parameter: the event structure that comes
;       from the widget. Note that the "name" of the object is added
;       as a field in every event structure.

; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;       This routine is called by the IDL system, not by a user.
;
; MODIFICATION_HISTORY:
;
;       Written by: David Burridge, 13th March 2003.
;       Added EVENT_NAME field to each event object, which contains the name of the widget event. 6 Feb 2004, DWF.
;       Made a change in which the Event_Method is retrieved from the object causing the event, rather
;         than from the event object itself. 19 July 2004. DWF.
;       Removed reference to TOP_OBJECT. 22 January 2005. DWF.
